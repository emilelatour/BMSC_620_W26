Each heading addresses a specific muddy point raised in class. Feel free to focus on the ones most relevant to you.\n:::\n\n## Overview\n\nThank you for your feedback on yesterday's lecture! The pacing feedback was excellent - 93% felt it was \"about right\" and only 7% \"slightly too fast,\" which tells me the pace is working well for most of you. I'll continue being mindful of pacing as we move forward.\n\nSeveral themes emerged from your muddy points. Let me address them:\n\n---\n\n## The \"About\" in Probability Interpretations\n\n**The Question:**\n\n> \"For the blood pressure percentiles, all of the interpretations have statements like '95% of men have DBP below about 99.7 mmHg.' Do you include the 'about' because it's rounded from the R output value? Would I say '95% of men have DBP below 99.73824 mmHg' or is the 'about' phrasing required by the actual mathematical formula?\"\n\n**The Answer:**\n\nGreat question! The \"about\" serves multiple purposes:\n\n### Reason 1: Acknowledging Model Uncertainty\n\nThe normal distribution is a **model** of reality, not reality itself. Real blood pressure distributions are only *approximately* normal. So when we say \"about 99.7 mmHg,\" we're acknowledging that:\n\n- The model is an approximation\n- Real biological data has natural variability\n- The exact cutoff is somewhat fuzzy\n\n### Reason 2: Practical Precision\n\nIn context, reporting \"99.73824 mmHg\" implies false precision:\n\n- Blood pressure is typically measured to the nearest whole number\n- The extra decimal places suggest more certainty than we actually have\n- \"About 100 mmHg\" or \"about 99.7 mmHg\" is more honest\n\n### When to Use \"About\"\n\n**Use \"about\" when:**\n\n- Interpreting real-world data (blood pressure, heights, test scores)\n- Rounding R output for readability\n- The context doesn't demand exact precision\n\n**You can omit \"about\" when:**\n\n- The problem asks for a precise calculation\n- You're reporting the exact R output in a technical context\n- The value is exact by definition (like standardized z-scores)\n\n**Bottom line:** Using \"about\" shows good statistical judgment. It acknowledges that models are approximations and that excessive precision can be misleading.\n\n---\n\n## `pnorm()` and `lower.tail`\n\n**The Question:**\n\n> \"For pnorm in R, is the 'lower.tail' automatically equal true if not included in the function?\"\n\n**The Answer:**\n\nYes! The default is `lower.tail = TRUE`.\n\n### What This Means\n\n```r\n# These are equivalent:\npnorm(1.96)\npnorm(1.96, lower.tail = TRUE)\n# Both give P(Z ≤ 1.96) ≈ 0.975\n```\n\n### When to Use `lower.tail = FALSE`\n\nUse this when you want the upper tail probability:\n\n```r\n# P(Z > 1.96)\npnorm(1.96, lower.tail = FALSE)  # ≈ 0.025\n```\n\n### Visual Guide\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_normal_poisson_muddy_points_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Pro tip:** Instead of using `lower.tail = FALSE`, you can also use the relationship:\n\n```r\n# These are equivalent:\npnorm(1.96, lower.tail = FALSE)\n1 - pnorm(1.96)\n```\n\nChoose whichever feels more intuitive to you!\n\n---\n\n## Continuous Distributions: Intervals and Single Points\n\n**The Question:**\n\n> \"Why are intervals always inclusive on a continuous distribution? Why is probability of a single point at a continuous distribution always 0? When do you use 'lower.tail = FALSE'?\"\n\n**Great Questions! Let me break these down:**\n\n### Why is P(X = exact value) = 0?\n\nFor continuous distributions, there are **infinitely many possible values** in any interval.\n\nThink about height:\n\n- What's the probability someone is *exactly* 170.00000... cm tall?\n- Not 170.001 cm or 169.999 cm, but precisely 170?\n\nThe probability is essentially 0 because any single point is infinitesimal compared to the infinite continuum.\n\n**Important:** This doesn't mean it's *impossible*; it just means the probability is so small (infinitely small) that it's mathematically zero.\n\n### Why doesn't it matter if we include endpoints?\n\nBecause P(X = exact value) = 0, these are all equivalent:\n\n```r\n# All of these give the SAME answer for continuous distributions:\npnorm(1.96) - pnorm(0)     # P(0 < Z < 1.96)\npnorm(1.96) - pnorm(0)     # P(0 ≤ Z ≤ 1.96)\npnorm(1.96) - pnorm(0)     # P(0 < Z ≤ 1.96)\npnorm(1.96) - pnorm(0)     # P(0 ≤ Z < 1.96)\n```\n\nAdding or removing a single point (like including/excluding exactly 0 or exactly 1.96) doesn't change the probability because each single point contributes 0.\n\n### When to use `lower.tail = FALSE`\n\nAlready covered above, but the key is:\n\n- `lower.tail = TRUE` (default): P(X ≤ value)\n- `lower.tail = FALSE`: P(X > value)\n\n---\n\n## Normal Approximation vs. Exact Binomial\n\n**The Question:**\n\n> \"Why would you use normal approximation if you can use exact (binomial) and it's more accurate and requires fewer lines of code?\"\n\n**Excellent question! Here's why:**\n\n### Historical Context\n\nThe normal approximation was developed **before computers existed**.\n\nWhen statisticians had to calculate probabilities by hand or using printed tables:\n\n- Computing $\\binom{1000}{487}$ was essentially impossible\n- Normal tables were available in the back of every textbook\n- The approximation was much faster and \"good enough\"\n\n### Modern Practice\n\nToday, with R, you're absolutely right:\n\n```r\n# Exact (better!)\npbinom(487, size = 1000, prob = 0.5)\n\n# Approximation (more work, less accurate)\npnorm(487.5, mean = 500, sd = sqrt(250))\n```\n\n**Use the exact binomial when you can!**\n\n### When Normal Approximation Still Matters\n\nThere are a few cases where we still use it:\n\n1. **Very large n**: When n is extremely large (n > 10,000), even computers can struggle with exact binomial calculations, and the normal approximation works very well\n\n2. **Theoretical understanding**: It helps you understand the connection between discrete and continuous distributions - a key concept in statistics\n\n3. **Historical methods**: Some older statistical techniques were built on normal approximations, and understanding them helps you read older research\n\n4. **Conceptual foundation**: The Central Limit Theorem (coming soon!) relies on this same approximation idea\n\n**Bottom line:** In practice, prefer the exact binomial. But understanding *why* the normal approximation works helps build your statistical intuition.\n\n### Summary: Exact vs. Normal Approximation (When to Use Which)\n\n#### Exact Binomial\n\nUses the true binomial probability formula:\n\n```r\ndbinom(k, size = n, prob = p)  # P(X = k)\npbinom(k, size = n, prob = p)  # P(X ≤ k)\n```\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n- Completely accurate\n- No approximation error\n- Easy in R\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n- Can be slow for very large n\n- Wasn't practical before computers\n\n#### Normal Approximation\n\nTreats the binomial as approximately normal when n is large:\n\n```r\n# Approximate a Binomial(n, p) with Normal(μ = np, σ² = np(1-p))\npnorm(k + 0.5, mean = n*p, sd = sqrt(n*p*(1-p)))\n```\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n- Fast even for huge n\n- Connects discrete and continuous ideas\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n- Less accurate (especially for small n or extreme p)\n- Requires continuity correction (the + 0.5)\n- More work in R\n\n#### When is the Approximation Good?\n\n**Rules of thumb:**\n\n- np ≥ 10 **and** n(1-p) ≥ 10\n\nOr more conservatively:\n\n- np ≥ 5 **and** n(1-p) ≥ 5\n\nIf these conditions aren't met, stick with the exact binomial!\n\n#### Key takeaway\n\nIn this course, use the exact binomial when possible.\n\nWe study the normal approximation to understand why it works and how discrete and continuous distributions connect.\n\n---\n\n## Outliers in Normal Distributions\n\n**The Question:**\n\n> \"In a boxplot we can call any observations that fall beyond 1.5x IQR (not standard deviation) above or below the 75th/25th percentile as outliers. In normal distributions given that 95% of observances fall within 2 SDs/ z-score of 2, can we call anything beyond 2 an outlier? Beyond 3 since these are considered 'very rare'? Or is there a different metric that can be used?\"\n\n**Great Connection to Make!**\n\nThere's some confusion here about boxplot rules vs. z-scores, so let me clarify:\n\n### Boxplot Rule (IQR Method)\n\nBoxplots define outliers as:\n\n- Below Q1 - 1.5×IQR\n- Above Q3 + 1.5×IQR\n\nThis is a **data-driven** rule that works for any distribution shape.\n\nNote: This is 1.5 times the **interquartile range (IQR)**, not 1.5 standard deviations!\n\n### Z-Score Method for Outliers\n\nFor normal distributions, common thresholds are:\n\n**|z| > 2:** Somewhat unusual (about 5% of data falls here)\n\n- Not necessarily \"outliers\" but worth noting\n- This is where roughly 95% of data falls within ±2 SD\n\n**|z| > 3:** Very unusual (about 0.3% of data falls here)\n\n- Often considered outliers\n- These are quite rare in truly normal data\n\n**|z| > 4:** Extremely unusual (about 0.006% of data falls here)\n\n- Almost certainly outliers or errors\n- Very rare in normal distributions\n\n### Which Method to Use?\n\n**Use the z-score method when:**\n\n- You're confident the data is approximately normal\n- You want to identify unusually extreme values\n- You're working with standardized scores\n\n**Use the IQR method when:**\n\n- You don't know if the data is normal\n- The data might be skewed\n- You want a robust method that works for any distribution\n\n**Bottom line:** There's no single \"correct\" threshold. In practice:\n\n- |z| > 3 is a reasonable outlier cutoff for normal data\n- The IQR method (boxplot rule) is more robust for unknown distributions\n- Always visualize your data and use domain knowledge!\n\n---\n\n## Quick Refresher on Binomial Distribution\n\n**The Request:**\n\n> \"I think the binomial distribution stuff relied a lot on previous knowledge so a quick refresher from Monday's class would have been nice\"\n\n**Fair point! Here's a quick recap:**\n\n### What is a Binomial Random Variable?\n\nA binomial counts **the number of successes in n independent trials**, where:\n\n- Each trial has only two outcomes (success/failure)\n- Probability of success p is the same for every trial\n- Trials are independent\n\n**Notation:** X ~ Binomial(n, p)\n\n### Key R Functions\n\n```r\n# P(X = k): exactly k successes\ndbinom(k, size = n, prob = p)\n\n# P(X ≤ k): at most k successes  \npbinom(k, size = n, prob = p)\n\n# P(X > k): more than k successes\npbinom(k, size = n, prob = p, lower.tail = FALSE)\n```\n\n### Example\n\n\"Flip a fair coin 10 times. What's the probability of exactly 6 heads?\"\n\n```r\ndbinom(6, size = 10, prob = 0.5)\n```\n\nGoing forward, I'll make sure to include brief refreshers when building on previous material!\n\n---\n\n## Deriving Equations and Establishing Values\n\n**The Concern:**\n\n> \"Deriving the equations and how we established certain values was a little unclear.\"\n\n**My Response:**\n\nYou're not expected to derive distribution formulas from scratch - that's advanced probability theory.\n\nWhat matters is:\n\n1. **Recognizing when to use each distribution** (binomial for counting successes, normal for continuous measurements, Poisson for rare events)\n\n2. **Understanding what the parameters mean** (n and p for binomial, μ and σ for normal, λ for Poisson)\n\n3. **Using R correctly** to calculate probabilities\n\n4. **Interpreting results** in context\n\nThe derivations are shown to give you insight into *why* the formulas work and to connect mathematical theory to practice - not because you need to reproduce them.\n\nIf specific derivations are still unclear, feel free to ask in office hours and I can walk through the intuition!\n\n---\n\n## Questions?\n\nIf anything is still muddy, please:\n\n- Come to office hours\n- Ask in class\n\nThanks for the thoughtful feedback! 📊\n",
