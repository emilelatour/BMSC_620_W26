I'm glad the format was helpful and that concepts like standard error vs. standard deviation are starting to click. Here are responses to the two muddy points:\n\n## Order of Operations in R\n\n**The question:** \"I don't quite understand when order of operations matters in R vs when it doesn't\"\n\nThis is a great practical question! Order of operations matters in R in some contexts but not others. Here's when to pay attention:\n\n### When order DOES matter:\n\n1. **Mathematical operations follow standard rules (PEMDAS):**\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2 + 3 * 4    # = 14 (multiplication first)\n(2 + 3) * 4  # = 20 (parentheses first)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIf you are unsure, use parentheses to make your intent explicit.\n\n2. **Piping with `%>%` is strictly left-to-right:**\n\nEach step modifies the object for the next step. This filters first, then summarizes.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata %>% \n  filter(age > 50) %>%  # Filter first\n  summarize(mean_bmi = mean(BMI))  # Then summarize filtered data\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nBut, this will not work because after summarize(), the age column no longer exists.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata %>% \n  summarize(mean_bmi = mean(BMI)) %>%  # Summarize first\n  filter(age > 50)  # This won't work - age doesn't exist after summarizing!\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**Pipes always execute sequentially.**\n\n3. **Function arguments process in the order you provide them:**\n\nThe p-value will be the same (two-sided), but the sign of the test statistic and direction of the difference change. Order matters when direction matters.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nt.test(group1, group2, alternative = \"two.sided\")\n# Different from:\nt.test(group2, group1, alternative = \"two.sided\")\n# The order of the groups changes the sign of the test statistic\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### When order DOESN'T matter:\n\n1. **Multiple `filter()` statements (they're all \"AND\" operations):**\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata %>% filter(age > 50) %>% filter(gender == \"Female\")\n# Same as:\ndata %>% filter(gender == \"Female\") %>% filter(age > 50)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n2. **Addition and multiplication (commutative operations):**\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n3 + 5  # same as 5 + 3\n4 * 7  # same as 7 * 4\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**Practical tips:** \n\n- When in doubt, use parentheses to make your intention clear\n- Test your code with small examples to make sure it's doing what you expect!\n- If your code depends on sequence (especially with pipes), read it top to bottom like a sentence. That is exactly how R executes it.\n\n## Standard Error vs Standard Deviation - When to Use Which?\n\n**The question:** \"Standard error vs. standard deviation - I'm not sure if I know when to use which one for real life data.\"\n\nExcellent question - this is one of the most important distinctions in statistics! Here's the practical guide:\n\n### Use **Standard Deviation (SD)** when describing your data:\n\n**Purpose:** Describes the *variability in the data itself*  \n**Question it answers:** \"How spread out are the individual observations?\"\n\n**Example scenarios:**\n\n- Reporting patient characteristics in a study: \"The mean BMI was 28.5 kg/m² (SD = 4.2)\"\n- Describing measurement variability: \"Systolic blood pressure ranged widely (mean = 125 mmHg, SD = 18)\"\n- Understanding individual-level variation: \"How much do patients differ in their cholesterol levels?\"\n\n**R code:** `sd(data$variable)`\n\n### Use **Standard Error (SE)** when making inferences about a population:\n\n**Purpose:** Describes the *uncertainty in your estimate of the mean*  \n**Question it answers:** \"How precise is my sample mean as an estimate of the true population mean?\"\n\n**Example scenarios:**\n\n- Constructing confidence intervals: \"95% CI = mean ± 1.96 × SE\"\n- Comparing groups: \"The difference in means was 5.2 (SE = 1.1)\"\n- Assessing precision of estimates: \"With a larger sample, our SE decreases\"\n\n**R code:** `sd(data$variable) / sqrt(length(data$variable))` or from test output\n\n### The key insight:\n\n- **SD describes your data** \n- **SE describes your estimate** \n\nAs sample size increases:\n\n- SD stays roughly the same\n- SE decreases\n\nThis is why larger studies have narrower confidence intervals and greater power.\n\n### Practical example with BMI:\n\nSuppose you measure BMI in 100 patients and get mean = 28 kg/m², SD = 5 kg/m²:\n\n- The **$SD = 5$** tells you: \"Individual patients' BMIs typically differ from the mean by about 5 kg/m²\"\n- The **$SE = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{100}} = 0.5$** tells you: \"If we repeated this study, our sample mean would typically differ from 28 by about 0.5 kg/m²\"\n\n**For the midterm:** You'll mostly encounter SE in the context of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests (it's built into the test statistics). You'll report SD when describing your sample's characteristics.\n\n## General Exam Tips\n\nSince this was a review session, a few reminders:\n\n- **Focus on concepts, not formulas** - you can use R for calculations\n- **Interpret results in context** - what does a p-value or confidence interval mean for the research question?\n- **Pay attention to assumptions** - when is each test appropriate?\n- **Practice reading R output** - know where to find what you need\n\nGood luck on the midterm! Feel free to come to office hours if you have questions.\n```\n",
