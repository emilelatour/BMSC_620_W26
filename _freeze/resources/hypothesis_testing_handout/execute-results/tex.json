Observations are **independent**\n2. Data are approximately **normal** OR sample size is large ($n \\geq 30$, CLT applies)\n\n---\n\n## Test statistic (what comes from the data)\n\nThe t-statistic measures how far the sample mean is from the null value, in standard error units:\n\n$$t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{s / \\sqrt{n}}$$\n\n- Comes from the **sample**\n- **Random** (varies from study to study)\n- Under $H_0$, follows a t-distribution with $df = n - 1$\n\n---\n\n## Critical value (what defines \"too extreme\")\n\n- Comes from the **t-distribution**\n- Depends on $\\alpha$ and degrees of freedom\n- **Fixed** before seeing the data\n\n$$t^* = t_{1-\\alpha/2,\\; df} \\quad \\text{(two-sided)}$$\n\n---\n\n## Decision rules (three equivalent ways)\n\n### 1. Test-statistic approach\n\n**Reject $H_0$ if:** $|t_{\\text{obs}}| > t^*$\n\n### 2. P-value approach\n\n**P-value:** Probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as (or more extreme than) what we saw, assuming $H_0$ is true.\n\n**Reject $H_0$ if:** $\\text{p-value} < \\alpha$\n\n### 3. Confidence interval approach (two-sided tests)\n\n**Reject $H_0$ if:** the $(1 - \\alpha) \\times 100$% confidence interval does **not** contain $\\mu_0$\n\n---\n\n## What p-values mean (and don't mean)\n\n::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"48%\"}\n**P-value IS:**\n\n- A measure of how surprising the data are if $H_0$ were true\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"48%\"}\n**P-value is NOT:**\n\n- The probability that $H_0$ is true\n- The probability you made a mistake\n- A measure of effect size or importance\n:::\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Common language to use\n\n✔️ \"We reject the null hypothesis\"  \n✔️ \"We fail to reject the null hypothesis\"\n\n❌ \"We accept the null hypothesis\"\n\n---\n\n## One-sample t-test in R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nt.test(x, mu = mu0, alternative = \"two.sided\", conf.level = 0.95)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Key output:**\n\n- t-statistic\n- degrees of freedom\n- p-value\n- confidence interval\n- sample mean\n\n---\n\n## Reporting results (example)\n\n> A one-sample t-test was conducted to assess whether mean body temperature differs from 98.6°F. The sample ($n = 130$) had a mean of 98.25°F (SD = 0.733). The test was statistically significant, $t(129) = -5.45$, $p < 0.001$, with a 95% confidence interval of [98.12, 98.38], indicating that the population mean body temperature is lower than 98.6°F.\n\n---\n\n## Big picture reminder\n\n- Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals use the **same information**\n- A small p-value does **not** imply practical importance\n- Always **interpret results in context**\n```\n\n",
