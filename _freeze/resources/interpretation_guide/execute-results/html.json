Use it as a checklist when writing up results for homework and exams.\n\nThe goal is not to produce a rigid formula. It is to communicate your findings clearly enough that someone unfamiliar with your analysis could understand what you did, what you found, and what it means.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nWhen in doubt, ask yourself: *Could someone read this and know exactly what test I ran, what I found, and what conclusion I drew?* If yes, you are in good shape.\n:::\n\n---\n\n# Step 1: State Your Hypotheses\n\nAlways state your hypotheses explicitly before conducting a test. Do not leave the reader to infer them from your conclusion.\n\nHypotheses should be stated in terms of a **population parameter**, not sample statistics.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n$$H_0: p = 0.5 \\quad \\text{versus} \\quad H_A: p \\neq 0.5$$\n\n$$H_0: p_1 = p_2 \\quad \\text{versus} \\quad H_A: p_1 \\neq p_2$$\n\n$$H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 \\quad \\text{versus} \\quad H_A: \\mu_1 \\neq \\mu_2$$\n\n$$H_0: \\text{There is no association between } X \\text{ and } Y \\quad \\text{versus} \\quad H_A: \\text{There is an association between } X \\text{ and } Y$$\n\nFor regression contexts:\n\n$$H_0: \\beta_1 = 0 \\quad \\text{versus} \\quad H_A: \\beta_1 \\neq 0$$\n\n---\n\n# Step 2: Report the Key Results\n\nA complete write-up includes all of the following:\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n**Checklist**\n\n- [ ] The **test statistic** and its type (e.g., $z$, $t$, $\\chi^2$)\n- [ ] The **$p$-value**, rounded to 3 decimal places (e.g., $p = 0.032$). If the $p$-value is less than 0.001, it is acceptable to report $p < 0.001$ rather than the exact value.\n- [ ] The **estimate of interest** with units (e.g., a proportion, mean difference, odds ratio)\n- [ ] A **95% confidence interval** for that estimate, with units\n- [ ] The **$\\alpha$ level** used for the decision\n- [ ] A **conclusion** about the null hypothesis\n:::\n\n**A note on transformed coefficients:** Do not report untransformed coefficients when the parameter of interest is on a different scale. For example, in logistic regression, report the **odds ratio** (and its 95% CI), not the log odds.\n\n---\n\n# Step 3: Write Your Conclusion Carefully\n\nTwo important rules:\n\n1. **We do not \"accept\" the null hypothesis.** We either *reject* $H_0$ or *fail to reject* $H_0$. A non-significant result does not prove the null is true --- it means we did not find sufficient evidence against it. The study may simply have been underpowered.\n\n2. **Frame your conclusion in the context of the problem.** Don't just say \"we reject $H_0$.\" Say what that means for the research question, in plain language, with appropriate hedging.\n\n---\n\n# A Complete Example\n\nThe following example illustrates all of the required components. Each label **(a)** through **(d)** corresponds to a checklist item.\n\n---\n\n> In a double-blind randomized clinical trial, there was a non-significant difference between the proportion of patients who died in the treatment and control groups (z-test, $z = -1.90$; $p = 0.058$) **(a)**.\n>\n> The proportion of patients who died in the control group was 8.1% (95% CI: 6.1% to 10.0%), and the proportion who died in the treatment group was 5.6% (95% CI: 3.9% to 7.3%). The proportion of patients who died in the treatment group was 2.5 percentage points lower (95% CI: 0.1 percentage points higher to 5.1 percentage points lower) than in the control group **(b)**.\n>\n> Since the $p$-value of 0.058 exceeds our pre-specified $\\alpha = 0.05$ **(c)**, there is marginal but insufficient evidence to conclude the true proportions differ, and we fail to reject the null hypothesis **(d)**. We conclude there is not a statistically significant difference in mortality between the treatment and control groups.\n\n---\n\n**What each label represents:**\n\n| Label | Component | What was reported |\n|---|---|---|\n| **(a)** | Test statistic and $p$-value | $z = -1.90$, $p = 0.058$, test type named |\n| **(b)** | Estimate + 95% CI with units | Risk difference = −2.5 percentage points (95% CI: −5.1 to 0.1 pp) |\n| **(c)** | $\\alpha$ level | Pre-specified $\\alpha = 0.05$ |\n| **(d)** | Conclusion about $H_0$ | Fail to reject $H_0$; conclusion stated in context |\n\n---\n\n# Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n**Saying \"we accept the null hypothesis\"**\n\n> ~~\"We accept $H_0$ and conclude there is no difference.\"~~\n\nFailing to reject is not the same as proving the null is true. A study with low power might miss a real effect.\n\n**Omitting the confidence interval**\n\nThe $p$-value tells you whether a result is statistically significant. The confidence interval tells you *how large* the effect might plausibly be. Both are needed.\n\n**Reporting a difference without units**\n\n> ~~\"The treatment group had a lower proportion.\"~~\n\nAlways specify the magnitude and units: *\"The treatment group had a proportion 2.5 percentage points lower (95% CI: 0.1 to 5.1 percentage points lower).\"*\n\n**Confusing \"percent\" and \"percentage points\"**\n\nA change from 8.1% to 5.6% is a difference of **2.5 percentage points** (absolute) and a **31% relative reduction**. These are not interchangeable. In most homework write-ups, you will report the absolute difference in percentage points.\n\n**Forgetting to name the test**\n\nAlways identify what test you used: *z-test, two-sample t-test, chi-squared test of independence*, etc.\n\n---\n\n# Quick Reference: Grading Criteria\n\nRecall that the interpretation and communication criterion in this course (2 points) looks for:\n\n> *Answers include written interpretation where appropriate, with an attempt to explain results in context (e.g., direction, magnitude, units, or meaning of statistical output).*\n\nUsing this guide as a checklist will help you meet that criterion consistently.\n",
