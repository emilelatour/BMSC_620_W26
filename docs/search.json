    "text": "BMSC 620: Introduction to Biostatistics\n\nWinter 2026\nWelcome to BMSC 620: Introduction to Biostatistics. This course introduces fundamental statistical methods commonly used in the biomedical and health sciences, with an emphasis on understanding, interpretation, and clear communication rather than mathematical derivations.\nWe will begin with descriptive statistics and graphical methods for summarizing data, followed by an introduction to basic probability concepts that motivate statistical inference. Key probability and sampling distributions, including the binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions, will be introduced as tools for understanding variability and uncertainty in data.\nThe course will then cover confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for one- and two-sample problems, using both parametric and nonparametric approaches. Additional topics include inference for proportions, analysis of two-way tables, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation, and simple linear regression.\nThroughout the course, emphasis will be placed on selecting appropriate statistical methods, interpreting results, and communicating conclusions in a way that is accessible to audiences without formal statistical training. Students will gain hands-on experience using statistical software (R) for basic data management, visualization, and interpretation of output generated by statistical analyses, as well as for building reproducible analytical workflows.\n\n\n\nInstructor\n Emile Latour, MS\n RJH 4320\n latour@ohsu.edu\n\n\nOffice Hours\nEmile  Thursday, 1:00 – 2:00 PM\n\n\nCourse details\n Mondays, Wednesdays\n January 5 – March 20\n 9:00 AM – 11:30 AM\n In-person, RJH 4320\nNote: Class will meet in MAC 3198 on January 21 only.\n\n\nContacting me\nE-mail is the best way to get in contact with me.

(Instructions will be posted on the Materials page.)\nOne-day room change: Class will meet in MAC 3198 on January 21 only.\n\n\n\nCourse description\nBMSC 620 introduces fundamental statistical methods commonly used in the biomedical and health sciences, with an emphasis on understanding, interpretation, and clear communication rather than mathematical derivations.\nWe will begin with descriptive statistics and graphical methods for summarizing data, followed by basic probability concepts that motivate statistical inference.

Students will gain hands-on experience using R for basic data management, visualization, and interpretation of statistical output.\n\n\nLearning objectives\nBy the end of this course, students should be able to:\n\nDescribe how data relate to a biomedical question of interest.\nSelect appropriate statistical methods for estimation and testing, and use statistical software to implement those methods.\nInterpret and communicate statistical findings to a non-statistical audience in context.\n\n\n\nInstructors and office hours\nSee the Instructors￼ page for contact information and office hours.\n\n\nMeeting times and location\n•   Days: Mondays and Wednesdays\n•   Dates: January 5 - March 20, 2026\n•   Time: 9:00 AM - 11:30 AM\n•   Location: RJH 4320 (except January 21 in MAC 3198)\nMaterials and software\nSee the Materials￼ page for links to software installation instructions, course handouts, datasets, and other resources.\nAssessment and grading\nYour grade will be based on the components below. (Details, rubrics, and due dates will be posted on the course website and in Sakai.) • Homework: Regular problem sets to practice concepts and R skills. • Quizzes: Periodic checks on core concepts and interpretation. • Participation / in-class work (if applicable): Any in-class activities or exit tickets will be described on the Assignments or Quizzes pages.\nGrading scale: (insert your program’s grading scheme or your planned cutoffs here)\nCollaboration and academic integrity\nYou are encouraged to discuss course concepts and work through problems with classmates. However, anything you submit must reflect your own understanding and be written in your own words.\nGenerative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT): You may use AI tools to help with learning, coding, and troubleshooting. However, the work you submit must be your own. If you use AI in a way that meaningfully affects your solution (code, wording, approach), cite it briefly (what you used it for and how).\nCourse policies and university resources\nOfficial institutional policies and student resources will be provided in Sakai. Please contact me if you have questions about accommodations, accessibility, or support resources.\nSchedule\nSee the Schedule￼ page for the current schedule. The schedule may be adjusted as needed.\n⸻\nAttribution note: This syllabus structure was adapted from departmental course materials, including a syllabus by Meike Niederhausen, with permission, and modified for BMSC 620."
