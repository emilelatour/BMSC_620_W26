Homework is primarily a formative assessment, meaning its purpose is to support learning rather than to assess perfection.\nThere will be regular homework assignments throughout the term. Assignments will typically include a mix of conceptual questions, interpretation, and applied work using R.\n\nGrading\nEach homework assignment will be graded on a 10-point scale using the following criteria:\n\nSubstantial completion (6 points)\nMost required parts of the assignment are attempted (approximately 75–80%). Code and written responses show a genuine effort to engage with the problems, even if some answers are incorrect.\nDemonstrated process (2 points)\nRelevant work is shown, including R code and intermediate steps where appropriate. The focus is on showing how you approached the problem rather than arriving at a perfect solution.\nInterpretation and communication (2 points)\nAnswers include written interpretation where appropriate, with an attempt to explain results in context (e.g., direction, magnitude, units, or meaning of statistical output).\n\nHomework will be graded primarily for effort, reasoning, and clarity, not strict correctness.\n\n\nFeedback and solutions\nHomework solutions will be released immediately after the submission deadline. This allows you to review the material and apply feedback while working on the next assignment, even if grading is still in progress.\nFor homework submitted on time, the TA will provide feedback on one or more problems.\nTurnaround time: Homework will be graded and returned within one week of the due date, with a target of Friday when possible.\n\n\nLate and dropped homework\n\nLate homework will be accepted for partial credit (up to 80% of the total points). Feedback will only be provided for homework submitted on time.\nThe lowest homework score will be dropped when calculating the final homework grade. HW 0 is excluded from this policy, as it is intended to ensure technical readiness for the course.\n\nThese policies are intended to provide flexibility for busy schedules while encouraging consistent engagement with the course material.",

Using R correctly\nYou should be comfortable with:\n\nChoosing the right R function (dbinom(), pbinom(), etc.)\nKnowing what each argument represents\nInterpreting the output in words\n\nFor example:\n\n“Exactly k successes” → dbinom()\n“At most k successes” → pbinom()\n\nBeing able to explain why you chose a function matters more than the numeric answer itself.\n\n\n3.

I don’t understand how it relates to other variance equations.”\n\nMy Response:\nThis is a great question.\nThe Bernoulli variance formula is not a new or special definition of variance. It comes from the same definition of variance we use for any random variable — it just simplifies nicely because a Bernoulli variable can only take two values (0 and 1).\nWhat’s important to know:\n\nVariance always measures how spread out values are around the mean\nFor a Bernoulli variable:\n\nThe mean is \\(p\\)\nOutcomes are either 0 or 1\n\nBecause of that simplicity, the general variance definition reduces to the compact result:\n\n\\[\\text{Var}(X) = p(1 - p)\\]\nYou do not need to derive this yourself. The key takeaway is the behavior of the variance:\n\nIt is largest when outcomes are most uncertain (\\(p\\) near 0.5)\n\nExample: \\(p = 0.5 \\rightarrow \\text{Var}(X) = 0.5(0.5) = 0.25\\)\n\nIt is smaller when outcomes are more predictable (\\(p\\) near 0 or 1)\n\nExample: \\(p = 0.9 \\rightarrow \\text{Var}(X) = 0.9(0.1) = 0.09\\) (less variable)\nExample: \\(p = 0.1 \\rightarrow \\text{Var}(X) = 0.1(0.9) = 0.09\\) (less variable)\n\n\nWe’ll continue to rely on this intuition and on R for calculations, rather than algebraic derivations."

I aimed to show that the probabilities don’t have to be the same for all possible outcomes.\n\nRolls of 1, 2, 3, or 4 all had the same probability: \\(1/9\\)\nA roll of 5 had a probability of \\(2/9\\)\nA roll of 6 had a probability of \\(3/9\\)\nProbabilities add to 1. Check: \\(1/9 + 1/9 + 1/9 + 1/9 + 2/9 + 3/9 = 1\\)\n\nThe dice is loaded toward higher numbers.\n\n\nThe big picture for expected value\nExpected value is best thought of as a long-run average, not a prediction of what will happen on a single trial.\n\nIt combines all possible values of a random variable\nEach value is weighted by how likely it is\nLarger values contribute more to the average than smaller values\n\nThis same idea applies to any random variable (not just dice) and is why expected value shows up throughout statistics.\nYou do not need to compute expected values by hand beyond simple examples like this. In practice, we’ll often:\n\nrely on formulas (for known distributions), or\nlet software do the calculation for us.\n\nThe important skill is understanding what expected value represents, not the mechanics of summing terms."

    "text": "Packages: what you need and when\nSeveral questions came up about R packages. Let me clarify:\n\nWhat are packages?\nPackages are collections of functions that extend R’s capabilities. Think of base R as a smartphone, and packages as apps you install to do specific tasks.\n\n\nThe packages we’re using in this course\nFor this course, you need these packages installed:\n\ntidyverse (this actually installs several packages including dplyr, ggplot2, and others)\njanitor (for the adorn_ functions)\n\nThat’s it for now. I’ll let you know when we need additional packages.\n\n\nInstall once, load each session\nThis is a common source of confusion:\nInstallation (do this once per computer):\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"janitor\")\n\nLoading (do this once per R session):\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\nThink of it like this:\n\nInstalling is like downloading an app to your phone (do once)\nLoading with library() is like opening that app (do every time you restart R)\n\n\n\nWhy do we need library() every session?\nYes, you need to run library(package_name) at the start of every R session (or at the top of every script/Quarto document). This tells R which packages you want to use for this particular analysis.\nIt might seem redundant, but it’s actually helpful because:\n\nIt makes your code more reproducible (others know exactly which packages you’re using)\nIt avoids conflicts when different packages have functions with the same name\nIt keeps R’s memory usage lower by only loading what you need"

Why would some clusters be more likely to be selected?\nOne question that came up was why certain clusters might have a higher chance of selection in multistage sampling.\nThis was a place where I misspoke in class (around the 57 mimute mark of the recording), so I want to clarify.\nFor the types of sampling designs we focus on in this course (and in the textbook), clusters are usually selected at random, with each cluster having the same probability of being chosen. You should generally think of cluster sampling as treating each cluster equally at the selection stage.\nMore complex designs where clusters have different selection probabilities do exist, but we will not be focusing on those, and we will not be getting into weighting in this course.\nTo help reinforce the distinction, here is a contrast between stratified sampling and cluster sampling.\nStratified sampling\n\nThe population is divided into strata such that units within each stratum are similar with respect to the variable(s) of interest.\nA random sample is then taken within each stratum.\nGoal: reduce variability within strata and ensure representation of important subgroups.\nResult:\n\nLow variability within strata\nHigher variability between strata\n\n\nCluster sampling\n\nThe population is divided into clusters such that:\n\nunits within a cluster are diverse, and\n\nclusters themselves are similar to one another.\n\n\nA random sample of clusters is selected, and then all units (or many units) within the selected clusters are included.\nGoal: improve practicality or reduce cost when sampling individuals directly is difficult.\nAs described in the textbook:\n\nHigh case-to-case variability within clusters\nClusters are similar to each other\n\n\nIn short:\n\nStratified sampling: simple random sample of units within every group\nCluster sampling: simple random sample of entire groups\n\nThank you for raising this!

    "title": "Response to Muddy Points",
    "section": "Conceptual Clarifications",
    "text": "Conceptual Clarifications\n\nAlternative vs “True” Hypothesis\nThe alternative hypothesis (\\(H_0\\) or \\(H_A\\)) is what we specify before collecting data. It’s our research hypothesis stating what we think might be true. There isn’t really a separate “true hypothesis” in the formal testing framework. In reality, either the null hypothesis is true or it isn’t, but we never observe that directly. We use our data to decide whether we have enough evidence to reject \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_A\\).\n\n\nOne-Sample vs Two-Sample t-tests\n“Is a one-variable t-test comparing a sample mean?” - Yes! A one-sample t-test compares one sample mean to a hypothesized population value (often \\(\\mu_0 = 0\\)). It’s “one variable” because you have one group of measurements.\n“Are t-tests always comparing a mean to a mean?” - Almost, but not quite:\n\nOne-sample t-test: Compares a sample mean to a fixed value (like \\(\\mu = 0\\))\nTwo-sample t-test: Compares two sample means to each other (we’ll cover this next week)\n\n\n\nOne-Sided vs Two-Sided Tests\nWhen to use one-sided: You need a strong scientific reason established before seeing your data. Examples where one-sided might be justified:\n\nTesting whether a new drug lowers blood pressure (can’t raise it by mechanism)\nTesting whether an educational intervention improves test scores (ethically, we wouldn’t use an intervention we think makes things worse)\nTesting whether a treatment is non-inferior to standard care\n\nDefault should be two-sided because:\n\nWe’re usually genuinely unsure which direction an effect might go\nTwo-sided tests are more conservative\nJournal reviewers/regulatory agencies often require two-sided tests\n\nIf you’re asking yourself “should I use one-sided?”, the answer is probably no.\n\n\nP-values and Confidence Intervals\n“Is \\(p \\gt \\alpha\\) inside the CI or not?” - Let me clarify this relationship:\n\nIf \\(p \\lt \\alpha\\): The null hypothesis value (like \\(\\mu = 0\\) is outside the confidence interval → we reject H₀\nIf \\(p \\ge \\alpha\\): The null hypothesis value is inside the confidence interval → we fail to reject \\(H_0\\)\n\nSo \\(p \\ge \\alpha\\) means the hypothesized value IS inside the CI (not outside). This relationship holds when the confidence level matches \\(\\alpha\\) (e.g., a 95% CI and \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\))\n\n\n“Low p-value was worse”\n\nSome of you may be thinking of situations where a “low score is bad” (e.g., exam scores, health indices). A p-value isn’t a score in that sense.\nA low p-value means the observed data would be unlikely if the null hypothesis were true. That’s all it measures. Not goodness, quality, or success.\n\n\nStatistical vs Practical Significance\n“How you can tell if p is actually relevant to real world data” - Great question! This is the difference between statistical and practical significance:\n\nStatistical significance (\\(p \\lt 0.05\\)): We have evidence of a difference\nPractical significance: The difference is large enough to matter\n\nExample: In a study of 10,000 people, we might find that a drug lowers blood pressure by 0.5 mmHg (\\(p = 0.001\\)). This is statistically significant but clinically meaningless. That small a change doesn’t affect patient outcomes.\nAlways interpret results in context: What is the effect size? Does the confidence interval include clinically important values?"

    "section": "Practical Questions",
    "text": "Practical Questions\n\nRandom Sampling in Clinical Trials\n“Does random sampling correspond to treatment group assignment or enrollment?”\nThese are two different types of randomization:\n\nRandom sampling refers to how we select participants from the population\nRandom assignment refers to how we assign participants to treatment groups\n\nIn clinical trials:\n\nEnrollment is usually not random (we recruit volunteers who meet criteria)\nTreatment assignment is randomized (patients randomly assigned to treatment vs control)\n\nThis is why clinical trials can establish causation (through random assignment) but may have limited generalizability (because enrollment isn’t a random sample of the population).\n\n\nDegrees of Freedom\n“Why is it n-1?” - Here’s the intuition: If you know the sample mean and \\(n-1\\) of the data points, the last data point is determined. It’s no longer “free” to vary.\nExample: If mean = 5 from 3 numbers, and you know two are 4 and 5, the third must be 6.\nThe \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom accounts for this loss of freedom when we estimate the mean from the data. You’re right that you don’t need to fully understand this to use it correctly. Just know that df = \\(n-1\\) for one-sample tests.\n\n\nWorking Across Multiple Computers\n“I work on laptop at work and desktop at home - does this create problems?”\nThis is exactly why R Projects and the here package are so valuable! As long as you:\n\nStore your project folder in Dropbox/OneDrive\nOpen the .Rproj file on each computer\nUse here() for file paths\n\n…everything will work seamlessly. The here() function builds paths relative to your project root, so it doesn’t matter what your username is or whether you’re on Mac/PC. Your file structure within the project stays the same.\nJust make sure cloud sync completes before switching computers!"

Specifically I’m having a hard time understanding logically how the margin of error contributes to confidence intervals.”\nA critical value (like \\(z^*\\) or \\(t^*\\)) is just a multiplier that determines how wide your confidence interval needs to be to achieve your desired confidence level.\nIt comes from the sampling distribution, not from your raw data.\nThink of it this way:\n\nWe start with a point estimate: \\(\\bar{x}\\) = 65 inches (our best guess for average height)\nWe know there’s uncertainty: SE = 0.5 inches\nQuestion: How many SEs should we go above and below our estimate to be 95% confident we’ve captured the true mean?\nAnswer: About 2 SEs (more precisely, 1.96 or ~2 for large samples)\n\nThat multiplier (1.96) is the critical value - it tells you “go this many standard errors in each direction.”\nThe margin of error is: critical value × SE\nSo if \\(t^* = 2.0\\) and \\(SE = 0.5\\), then \\(\\text{margin of error} = 2.0 × 0.5 = 1.0 inch\\).\nWhy does this work? Because of how the normal/t-distribution works:\n\n95% of the probability sits within ±1.96 standard deviations of the mean\nSo if we go ±1.96 SEs from our sample mean, we’ll capture μ about 95% of the time across repeated samples\n\nIn R:\n\n# For a 95% CI with df = 30\nqt(0.975, df = 30)  # Returns ~2.04 (the critical value)\n\n[1] 2.042272\n\n# We use 0.975 because we want 2.5% in each tail (95% in middle)\n\nThe critical value gets smaller as your sample size increases (because you have more certainty)."

Once you’ve calculated your CI, it either contains μ or it doesn’t - there’s no probability about it. The randomness is in the sampling process, not in μ.\nHelpful analogy: Imagine μ is a bullseye on a target that’s hidden behind a curtain. Each sample is like throwing a net at the target. The net has a specific size (your CI). If you throw 100 nets, about 95 of them will catch the bullseye. But once you’ve thrown your net, it either caught the target or it didn’t - you just don’t know which.\nThe “95% confidence” refers to the long-run success rate of the procedure, not the probability for one specific interval."

Because when you calculate a CI or do a hypothesis test, you’re asking: “If I repeated this study many times, how much would my sample mean vary?” That’s the sampling distribution.\nYou use your one sample to estimate properties of the sampling distribution:\n\n\\(SE = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) estimates the standard deviation of the sampling distribution\nThen you use that to build your CI\n\nIn practice:\n\nYou collect one sample → calculate one \\(\\bar{x}\\) and one \\(s\\)\nYou use those to estimate properties of the sampling distribution (via SE)\nYou use the sampling distribution to make inferences about \\(\\mu\\)\n\nThe sample distribution tells you about your sample.

If you start with sample # -1 how would you run out of degrees of freedom especially if it is a large dataset”\nQ: “I’m still a bit confused what you mean that the mean uses up a degree of freedom. I don’t really understand what degrees of freedom are.”\nDegrees of freedom (df) = the number of independent pieces of information you have left after estimating something.\nWhy n-1 instead of n?\nImagine you have 3 numbers and I tell you:\n\nTheir mean is 10\nTwo of the numbers are 8 and 12\nWhat’s the third number?\n\nYou can figure it out! It MUST be 10 (because (8 + 12 + 10)/3 = 10).\nOnce you know the mean and n-1 values, the last value is completely determined. So you only have n-1 “free” values that contain independent information.\nHow does the mean “use up” a degree of freedom?\nWhen you calculate the sample standard deviation (s), you use the formula:\n\\[s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}\\]\nYou’re calculating deviations from \\(\\bar{x}\\) (not from μ). Since you had to estimate \\(\\bar{x}\\) from the same data, you “used up” one piece of information. That leaves you with n-1 independent deviations. That’s why the t-distribution depends on df — it reflects how much uncertainty remains.\nLarge datasets: You never “run out” of df. Larger samples simply have larger df. As n gets large, df gets large too, and the t-distribution looks almost identical to the normal distribution.\nPractical impact:\n\nSmall samples (n = 5, df = 4): t-distribution has heavy tails, wider CIs\nLarge samples (n = 100, df = 99): t-distribution ≈ normal distribution, narrower CIs\n\nIn R:\n\n# t-distribution with df = 4 (small sample)\nqt(0.975, df = 4)  # Returns ~2.78\n\n[1] 2.776445\n\n# t-distribution with df = 99 (large sample)  \nqt(0.975, df = 99)  # Returns ~1.98 (very close to z* = 1.96)\n\n[1] 1.984217"

Does it have to do with balancing size of the interval with confidence level? Am I thinking correctly that the intervals will be bigger at 99% than at 95%?”\nYes, you’re thinking correctly! 99% CIs are wider than 95% CIs.\nThe tradeoff:\n\nHigher confidence (99%) → wider interval (less precise)\nLower confidence (90%) → narrower interval (more precise)\n\nWhy 95%? It’s mostly convention, established early in the history of statistics:\n\nHistorical precedent: R.A. Fisher and other early statisticians popularized 0.05 as the significance level, which corresponds to 95% confidence\nReasonable balance: 95% gives you high confidence without making intervals so wide they’re useless\nField standard: Everyone uses it, so it’s easier to compare across studies\n\nIs 95% “special”? Not really. In some fields:\n\nParticle physics uses 99.9999% (5-sigma rule) because errors are very costly\nSome exploratory research uses 90% to be less conservative\nClinical trials might use 99% for safety endpoints\n\nYour intuition is correct: There’s a balance between confidence and precision.\nExample:\n\n# For the same data (x̄ = 65, s = 3, n = 50)\n# 90% CI\n65 + qt(c(0.05, 0.95), df = 49) * (3/sqrt(50))\n\n[1] 64.2887 65.7113\n\n# Narrower interval\n\n# 95% CI  \n65 + qt(c(0.025, 0.975), df = 49) * (3/sqrt(50))\n\n[1] 64.14741 65.85259\n\n# Medium interval\n\n# 99% CI\n65 + qt(c(0.005, 0.995), df = 49) * (3/sqrt(50))\n\n[1] 63.86299 66.13701\n\n# Wider interval\n\nIn biomedical research: 95% is standard, but you might see 99% for safety-critical decisions or 90% for preliminary/exploratory analyses."

If you truly knew σ exactly for your population, inference would be much less common, which is why this situation is rare in practice.\nWhen to use Z (rare):\n\nYou know the population SD (\\(\\sigma\\)) from extensive prior research\nExample: IQ scores (\\(\\sigma\\) = 15 is well established)\nExample: Standardized test scores where \\(\\sigma\\) is published\n\nWhen to use t (almost always):\n\nYou estimate the SD from your sample (use \\(s\\) instead of \\(\\sigma\\))\nThis is the typical situation in biomedical research\n\nExample scenarios:\n✅ Use t: You measure blood pressure in 30 patients with a new treatment. You calculate \\(\\bar{x}\\) = 125 and s = 15 from your data.\n❌ Don’t use z: You don’t know σ for blood pressure in this population (you only have s from your sample)\n✅ Could use z (but probably still use t): You measure IQ in 30 patients. You know from decades of research that σ = 15 for IQ in the general population.\nPractical advice: Just use t-based CIs for everything. As sample size increases, the t-distribution converges to the normal distribution anyway, so you’re not losing anything by using t.\nIn R:\n\n# t-based CI (standard approach)\nt.test(data$variable)$conf.int\n\n# You rarely need to manually use z"

What about lab work? I run n = 5 experiments and looking at stimulation of cells (for example). Would you ever know the population parameters for something like this? Would you theoretically have to test ALL the cells to get this?”\nQ: “More of how this all applies to scenarios we may see in our work: I am unsure when the goal of a research question is to describe the data or estimate a population. I work in cell biology and do lots of quantitative microscopy, and when reporting results I am describing what I see in the sample of cells I imaged, is the goal then to extrapolate this to the general population of cells?”\nExcellent questions! The concept of “population” in lab research is more abstract but still applies.\nFor cell biology/microscopy:\nYour population is not all cells that exist in the universe, but rather:\n\nAll cells that COULD be generated under the same experimental conditions\nThe “infinite hypothetical” cells you could culture/image under identical protocols\nAll cells of this type under these specific conditions\n\nExample:\n\nYou image 50 cells in a microscopy experiment\nThose 50 cells are a SAMPLE\nThe POPULATION is “all cells of this type cultured under these conditions”\nμ = the true mean fluorescence intensity for this cell line under these conditions\nYou’ll never measure ALL possible cells, but μ exists conceptually\n\nDo you ever know μ? No, basically never. You always estimate it from your sample.\nThe statistical framework still applies:\n\nYou have 5 independent experimental replicates (n = 5)\nYou calculate \\(\\bar{x}\\) (mean cell stimulation) and s (SD of your replicates)\nYou use df = 4, and the t-distribution to build a CI for μ\nThis tells you about the “true” mean response of cells under these conditions\n\nWhen to use t-tests in lab work:\n✅ Comparing treatment vs. control in cell stimulation (n = 5 replicates per group) ✅ Comparing fluorescence intensity across conditions (n = 50 cells imaged per condition) ✅ Any situation where you have a sample and want to infer about the broader biological phenomenon\nKey insight: The “population” in basic science is often conceptual/theoretical rather than an actual enumerable group. But that’s okay! The statistics still work because you’re making inferences about what would happen if you repeated the experiment infinitely."

The interpretation part for SE isn’t clicking to me for some reason.”\nDifferent purposes, both useful:\nRule of thumb: Use SD to describe variability in your data and SE (or a CI) to describe uncertainty in the mean.\nReport SD when:\n\nDescribing the variability in your sample/population\nShowing “how spread out are the individual values?”\nExample: “Cell diameter was 12.3 μm (SD = 2.1 μm)” → tells reader that individual cells vary by ~2 μm\n\nReport SE when:\n\nDescribing uncertainty in your ESTIMATE of the mean\nShowing “how confident are we in our estimate of the population mean?”\nExample: “Mean cell diameter was 12.3 μm (SE = 0.3 μm)” → tells reader that the true mean is probably very close to 12.3\n\nIn practice for cell biology/microscopy:\nYou often report both or use error bars to show uncertainty:\n\nBar plots with error bars = SE (shows precision of your mean estimate)\nText description = SD (shows biological variability)\n\nExample reporting:\n\n“Mean fluorescence intensity was 1250 AU (SD = 300 AU, n = 50 cells). This represents a statistically significant increase compared to control (mean = 900 AU, SE = 45 AU, p &lt; 0.001).”\n\nWhy both?\n\nSD (300) tells you: individual cells vary quite a bit\nSE (45) tells you: but we’re quite confident in the mean difference\n\nRemember:\n\nSD describes your data (larger is more variable)\nSE describes your uncertainty (larger is less certain)\nSE = SD/√n (so SE is always smaller than SD)\n\nCommon in papers:\n\nError bars in figures are often SEM or CIs (check journal conventions)\nText descriptions include both SD and n\n\nGoal:\n\nAre you describing the phenomenon? → SD\nAre you making an inference about the population mean? → SE\n\nFor your microscopy work: you’re doing both! You’re describing what you see (SD) AND extrapolating to the general population of cells (SE for uncertainty in your mean estimate)."

    "text": "When and Why to Use CLT\nQ: “Still a little unclear on why you would want to use CLT and in what context it would be useful by itself? Also, how do you determine the degree of skew is too much skew and you need to increase n? How is that defined, other than eye-balling a histogram?”\nWhy CLT is useful:\nThe CLT allows you to do statistical inference even when your data are NOT normally distributed!\nExample:\n\nYou measure hospital length of stay (very right-skewed: most stays are short, few are very long)\nYour sample distribution looks nothing like a normal distribution\nBut: Because of CLT, you know that the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{x}\\) IS approximately normal (if n is large enough)\nThis lets you use t-tests and CIs even though your raw data are skewed\n\nWhen is n “large enough”?\nRules of thumb: These are heuristics, not strict rules. They’re meant to guide judgment, not replace it.\n\nn ≥ 30 is the classic rule (works for most distributions)\nn &lt; 30 can still work if your data are not too skewed\nn &gt; 15 usually fine for symmetric distributions\nHighly skewed data might need n &gt; 50\n\nHow to assess skewness:\nBeyond eyeballing histograms…\n\nSkewness &lt; 1 and n ≥ 15: probably fine\nSkewness between 1-2 and n ≥ 30: should be okay\nSkewness &gt; 2: might need n &gt; 50, or consider transformations/non-parametric methods\n\nWhen CLT “by itself” is useful:\nYou use CLT implicitly every time you:\n\nCalculate a CI for a mean (you assume the sampling distribution is normal)\nDo a t-test (same assumption)\nMake probability statements about sample means\n\nExample: “If we sample 50 patients, what’s the probability our sample mean is within 2 units of the true mean?” CLT lets you answer this even if individual patient values are skewed."

    "text": "Understanding t* Beyond the R Code\nQ: “I’m also kind of confused on what the calculations for t* actually is beyond plugging it into the R code.”\nWhat t* actually represents:\nThe t* value tells you: “How many standard errors away from the mean do I need to go to capture the middle X% of the t-distribution?”\nExample with 95% CI:\n\nqt(0.975, df = 20)  # Returns ~2.086\n\n[1] 2.085963\n\n\nThis means: “In a t-distribution with 20 degrees of freedom, if I go ±2.086 standard errors from the mean, I’ll capture 95% of the distribution.”\nWhy 0.975 instead of 0.95?\nThe t-distribution (like the normal distribution) is symmetric. For a 95% CI:\n\nYou want 95% in the middle\nThat leaves 5% in the tails\nSplit evenly: 2.5% in each tail\nSo you want the value that has 2.5% to its right (97.5% to its left)\nThat’s why we use qt(0.975, df) not qt(0.95, df)\n\nWhat’s happening inside qt()?\nWithout going into the math details:\n\nR has the mathematical formula for the t-distribution\nIt’s solving: “What value of t has exactly 97.5% of the distribution to its left?”\nIt uses numerical methods to find this value\n\nVisual intuition:\nImagine the t-distribution as a hill:\n\nThe peak is at 0\nqt(0.975, df) finds the point where 97.5% of the area under the curve is to the left\nThis point gets closer to 1.96 (the z value) as df increases\n\nYou don’t need to calculate it by hand - that’s why we use R! But understanding that it’s a percentile of the t-distribution (like how 1.96 is the 97.5th percentile of the normal distribution) helps build intuition.\nPractical use:\n\nSmall df (5) → t* is large (2.57) → wider CIs (less certainty)\nLarge df (100) → t* is small (1.98) → narrower CIs (more certainty)\nInfinite df → t* = z* (1.96) → t-distribution becomes normal"

Also the homework is taking me approximately 3-4 hours to complete, I am concerned with how long this is that the exam will be extremely long. Also, I know we will have an exam review, but maybe letting us know what kind of tasks we will need to be able to perform would help direct us.”\nThank you - this is helpful feedback.\nHomework clarity:\n\nI will add clearer labels in the homework templates (e.g., GIVEN vs YOUR TASK) and make the prompt for each part more explicit.\nIf something feels ambiguous while you are working, please reach out right away (office hours or email). Often a 2-minute clarification can save you a lot of time.\n\nHomework time:\nHomework is meant to be the main place you practice and build fluency, so it may take a few hours. If you find that a particular question is confusing or taking disproportionately long, let us know - that is useful information for improving the assignment.\nMidterm expectations:\nThe midterm is not designed to be a short, in-class exam. It will be a longer, take-home style assessment that is intended to take roughly 3–5 hours.\n\nYou will not need to memorize formulas.\nThe focus will be on applying ideas correctly and communicating your reasoning.\nYou should expect tasks similar in style to the homework, but more focused.\n\nBefore the midterm, I will provide guidance on:\n\nthe core concepts to prioritize,\nthe types of questions to expect,\nand a small set of practice problems."

    "text": "Multiplication rule vs. conditional probability\nOne excellent question was: “I think I’m getting confused between the multiplication rule and conditional probability. Conditional probability is more ‘if this, then what about that’ and the multiplication rule is ‘if this and that’. But what is the difference, for instance between ‘positive results and has disease’ vs ‘of those who have positive results, how many have disease’? Is the difference just in the denominator?”\nThis is a great question because these concepts are closely related.\n\nConditional probability\nConditional probability answers: “Given that A happened, what’s the probability of B?”\n\\[P(B|A) = \\frac{P(A \\text{ and } B)}{P(A)}\\]\nFor example: “Of those who test positive, what proportion actually have the disease?”\nThe denominator is \\(P(\\text{positive test})\\) — we’re restricting our focus to only those who tested positive.\n\n\nMultiplication rule\nThe multiplication rule calculates the probability that both A and B happen together:\n\\[P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B|A)\\]\nFor example: “What’s the probability someone has the disease AND tests positive?”\nThis gives you the joint probability of both events occurring.\n\n\nThe relationship\nYou’re absolutely right that the denominator is the key difference:\n\nConditional probability divides by \\(P(A)\\) to find the proportion within a subset\nMultiplication rule multiplies to find the probability of both events together\n\nThey’re mathematically related — in fact, the multiplication rule comes from rearranging the conditional probability formula:\n\\[P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(B|A) \\times P(A)\\]\n\n\nExample with numbers\nSuppose:\n\n1% of people have a disease: \\(P(\\text{disease}) = 0.01\\)\nThe test is 95% accurate for those with disease: \\(P(\\text{positive}|\\text{disease}) = 0.95\\)\n\nConditional probability: Of those with disease, 95% test positive.\nMultiplication rule: The probability of having disease AND testing positive is: \\[P(\\text{disease and positive}) = 0.01 \\times 0.95 = 0.0095\\]\nSo about 0.95% of the entire population has disease and tests positive.\nThe conditional probability focuses on a rate within a subgroup. The multiplication rule gives you the overall joint probability."

    "text": "How does R know that “n” is the count column?\nOne question was: “I was also a little confused when you used the example in class: dplyr::count(Species) %&gt;% mutate(proportion = n / sum(n)), how R knew that ‘n’ was the title for the column of counts.”\nGreat observation! This is specific to how the count() function works in dplyr.\n\nWhat count() does\nWhen you use count(), it automatically:\n\nGroups the data by the variable(s) you specify\nCounts the number of rows in each group\nAlways names the count column “n”, unless you name it something else using the name = argument (see ?dplyr::count)\n\nFor example:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\niris %&gt;%\n  count(Species)\n\n     Species  n\n1     setosa 50\n2 versicolor 50\n3  virginica 50\n\n\nThis creates a table with two columns: - Species (the grouping variable) - n (the counts — automatically named by count())\n\n\nWhy we can use “n” in mutate()\nBecause count() always creates a column called n, we can refer to it by that name in the next step:\n\niris %&gt;%\n  count(Species) %&gt;%\n  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n))\n\n     Species  n proportion\n1     setosa 50  0.3333333\n2 versicolor 50  0.3333333\n3  virginica 50  0.3333333\n\n\nThis works because: - count() created a column named n - mutate() sees that column and can use it in calculations\n\n\nWhat if you want a different name?\nYou can rename the count column if you want:\n\niris %&gt;%\n  count(Species, name = \"total\")\n\n     Species total\n1     setosa    50\n2 versicolor    50\n3  virginica    50\n\n\nNow the count column is called total instead of n.\n\n\nBottom line\nThe name n isn’t magic — it’s just the default name that count() gives to the count column. Once you know that pattern, you can use n in subsequent operations."

It’s essentially the same thing, just with slightly nicer printing and behavior. When you see tibble, think “data table.”\nPipe (%&gt;%): An operator that passes the output of one function as input to the next function. Helps you chain operations together in a readable way.\nmutate(): Creates new columns or modifies existing ones in a data frame\ncount(): Counts the number of rows for each group and automatically creates a column called n with the counts\n\nWe’ll use all of these extensively next week, and I’ll make sure to introduce them more carefully."

    "text": "Conceptual Clarifications\n\nHypothesis Testing Ethics: Can You Change Your Hypothesis After Seeing Data?\n“What if we failed to reject the null, then tested the opposite direction?”\nThis is an excellent ethical question that gets at the heart of hypothesis testing. You should not reframe a confirmatory hypothesis after looking at the data. Here’s why:\nThe entire hypothesis testing framework is built on specifying your hypothesis before collecting data. When you set \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), you’re accepting a 5% chance of a false positive. But if you:\n\nTest one direction (e.g., caffeine increases tapping) → get \\(p = 0.10\\)\nThen test the other direction (caffeine decreases tapping) → get \\(p = 0.03\\)\n\nYou’ve now done two tests, each with a 5% false positive rate. Your actual false positive rate is higher than 5% (this is the multiple testing problem we’ll discuss later in the course). Conceptually, you are giving yourself multiple chances to find significance after seeing the data.\nWhat you CAN do:\n\nReport the result as exploratory: “We found a non-significant trend toward increased tapping. Interestingly, there was a significant decrease…”\nUse the finding to design a new study with an a priori hypothesis\nBe transparent in publications: “This was a post-hoc analysis”\n\nThe key is transparency about what was pre-specified vs discovered during analysis.\n\n\nToo Many Options: What Should I Actually Use?\n“Giving all the options confuses me - what do you mainly use?”\nFair feedback! I show you multiple approaches so you can understand different code you might encounter, but here’s what I recommend you actually use:\nFor t-tests, use this approach:\n# Two independent samples\nt.test(outcome ~ group, data = mydata)\n\n# Two independent samples (long format)\nt.test(outcome ~ group, data = mydata) \n\n# Paired samples (long format - one outcome column, one time/condition column)\nt.test(outcome ~ group, data = mydata, paired = TRUE)\n\n# Paired samples (wide format - separate before/after columns)\nt.test(x = mydata$after, y = mydata$before, paired = TRUE)\n\n# One sample\nt.test(mydata$variable, mu = 0)\nIf you remember only one thing: use the formula interface for two-sample tests, and add paired = TRUE only when the same units are measured twice.\nWhy this approach?\n\nWorks with tidyverse piping\nClear syntax showing what you’re comparing\nEasy to modify (just add paired = TRUE or change mu)\nYou’ll see this format in most modern R code\n\nYou can ignore the rstatix package methods for now unless you’re specifically doing grouped analyses. I mention them so you’ll recognize them if you see them in other people’s code or Stack Overflow."

Depends on where you run code\nWith here:\nlibrary(here)\ndata &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"nhanes.csv\"))  # Always works!\nThe magic: here() always builds paths from your project root (where the .Rproj file lives), regardless of:\n\nWhat folder your script is in\nWhether you run code line-by-line or knit the whole document\n\nWhether you’re on Mac, PC, or different computers\n\nThink of it as: here() says “start at my project folder, then go into data folder, then grab nhanes.csv”\nWhen to use it: Anytime you’re reading or writing files in your project. You’ll get practice with this in upcoming homework.\nIf this still feels abstract right now, that’s normal. It usually “clicks” the first time a project breaks without here()."

    "text": "Understanding t.test() Arguments\n\nWhy mu = 0 Sometimes But Not Always?\n“Why set mu = 0 for DiffChol but not when comparing two columns?”\nGreat observation! The key thing to understand: mu = 0 is the default for ALL t-tests — I just chose when to write it explicitly.\nOne-sample t-test:\nt.test(chol$DiffChol, mu = 0)  # Explicit\nt.test(chol$DiffChol)           # Same thing - mu = 0 is default\nTwo-sample t-test (paired):\nt.test(x = chol$After, y = chol$Before, paired = TRUE)           # mu = 0 by default\nt.test(x = chol$After, y = chol$Before, paired = TRUE, mu = 0)   # Could write this too\nWhy I sometimes write it explicitly:\nIn the one-sample example with DiffChol, I wrote mu = 0 to emphasize what we’re testing: “Is the mean difference equal to zero?” It makes the null hypothesis more visible in the code.\nIn the two-sample paired example, I left it off because it’s the default and the syntax already makes it clear we’re comparing before and after values.\nBoth are testing difference = 0 — I just chose to be explicit about it in the one-sample case for teaching purposes. You could write mu = 0 in every t-test call, or leave it off in all of them. The code does the same thing either way. The definition of the difference depends on the test (one-sample, paired, or two-sample), but the default null value does not.\n\n\nPaired vs Independent: The Resistance Model Question\n“Would a resistance model be paired or independent?”\nThis is a nuanced question! Let’s think through it:\nPaired data requires: The same biological unit measured twice, or closely matched units.\nYour scenario: Resistant cells vs naive cells from the same original culture.\nThis is independent samples because:\n\nThey’re different cells (not the same cells measured twice)\nEven though they share an ancestor, they’ve undergone different selection pressures\nYou’re comparing two distinct populations that have diverged\n\nWhen it WOULD be paired:\n\nIf you measured gene expression in cells, then treated them, then measured again (same cells, before/after)\nIf you had matched tumor samples from the same patient (primary vs metastatic site)\n\nThe key question: “Am I measuring the exact same thing twice, or two related but distinct things?” In your case, it’s the latter. Shared origin does not automatically imply pairing — pairing requires a one-to-one linkage between measurements.\nIn practice, shared background like this is better handled with blocking or mixed models, which is out of scope for this course. But for t-test decision rules, this is not paired data.\nI think about this example like: “If I accidentally swapped the labels on three of my ‘resistant’ wells, could I still reconstruct exactly which ‘naive’ wells they were supposed to be paired with?” In a true paired design (like a patient’s left and right eye), the answer is yes. In a lineage model, the answer is no — the pairing is not intrinsic.\nLeft and right eyes are paired because they are two measurements on the same indivisible experimental unit; resistant and naive lineages are not, because they are separate populations whose relationship exists only through experimental history, not identity."

This is just a convention and something we will revisit once we start formal inference.\nRelatedly, one person mentioned confusion about the “squared SD”:\n\nThe variance is the standard deviation squared.\nVariance has squared units, which is why we usually report the standard deviation instead."

For example:\n\nseq(from = 1, to = 12, by = 3)\n\n[1]  1  4  7 10\n\n\nThis creates a sequence that:\n\nStarts at 1 (from = 1)\nEnds at 12 (to = 12)\nIncreases by 3 each step (by = 3)\n\nSo you get: 1, 4, 7, 10\n\n\nArgument order doesn’t matter when you name them\nOne key point about R functions: when you name the arguments, the order doesn’t matter:\n\nseq(from = 1, to = 12, by = 3)\n\n[1]  1  4  7 10\n\nseq(by = 3, to = 12, from = 1)\n\n[1]  1  4  7 10\n\n\nBoth produce exactly the same result because R knows which value goes with which argument.\n\n\nWhen you don’t name them, argument order does matter\n\nseq(1, 12, 3)\n\n[1]  1  4  7 10\n\nseq(3, 12, 1)\n\n [1]  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12\n\n\n\n\nHow to learn about any function\nThe most important takeaway: whenever you see a function you don’t recognize (or want to remember how it works), use the help system:\n\n?seq\n\nThis will show you:\n\nWhat arguments the function takes\nWhat each argument means\nExamples of how to use it\n\nThis works for any function in R. Get in the habit of typing ?function_name whenever you’re unsure.\n\n\nWhy I used seq() as an example\nI used seq() not because you need to memorize it for this class, but to illustrate how functions work in general: they take named inputs (arguments) and produce outputs. The specific function doesn’t matter as much as understanding that pattern."

It was not meant to be an example of analysis code you would normally write.\nIn general:\n\nc(3:10) creates a vector and prints it to the console\nb &lt;- c(3:10) creates the same vector and stores it so it can be reused later\n\nAssigning objects allows you to:\n\nreuse results\nbuild analyses step-by-step\ndebug your work\nwrite reproducible code\n\nIn practice, almost everything we do in R involves creating objects and then working with them.

    "text": "Marginal vs. Conditional Distributions\nOne muddy point was about the difference between marginal and conditional distributions.\nThis is a really important distinction, so let’s break it down with a concrete example.\n\nA Simple Example: Gender and Smoking Status\nImagine we have data on 100 people, classified by gender and smoking status:\n\n# Create example data\nsmoking_data &lt;- matrix(c(15, 35, 25, 25), \n                       nrow = 2,\n                       dimnames = list(\n                         Gender = c(\"Male\", \"Female\"),\n                         Smoker = c(\"Yes\", \"No\")\n                       ))\nsmoking_data\n\n        Smoker\nGender   Yes No\n  Male    15 25\n  Female  35 25\n\n\n\n\nMarginal Distribution: Looking at ONE variable\nMarginal distributions answer questions like: “What proportion of our sample is male?” or “What proportion smokes?”\nYou get these by summing across rows or columns:\n\n# Marginal distribution for Gender (sum across columns)\nrowSums(smoking_data)\n\n  Male Female \n    40     60 \n\n# As proportions\nprop.table(rowSums(smoking_data))\n\n  Male Female \n   0.4    0.6 \n\n\nThis tells us: 40% of our sample is male, 60% is female. We’re ignoring smoking status entirely.\n\n# Marginal distribution for Smoker (sum across rows)\ncolSums(smoking_data)\n\nYes  No \n 50  50 \n\n# As proportions\nprop.table(colSums(smoking_data))\n\nYes  No \n0.5 0.5 \n\n\nThis tells us: 50% of our sample smokes, 50% doesn’t. We’re ignoring gender entirely.\n\n\nConditional Distribution: Looking at relationships\nConditional distributions answer questions like: “Among males, what proportion smokes?” or “Among smokers, what proportion is male?”\nYou calculate these within a specific row or column:\n\n# Conditional distribution of smoking GIVEN gender\n# (proportions within each row)\nprop.table(smoking_data, margin = 1)\n\n        Smoker\nGender         Yes        No\n  Male   0.3750000 0.6250000\n  Female 0.5833333 0.4166667\n\n\nThis tells us:\n\nAmong males: 38% smoke, 63% don’t\nAmong females: 58% smoke, 42% don’t\n\nThis is P(Smoker | Gender) — the probability of smoking given someone’s gender.\n\n\nThe Key Difference\n\nMarginal: What’s the overall distribution of one variable? (Ignores other variables)\nConditional: What’s the distribution of one variable within a specific group of another variable? (Shows relationships)\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters\nConditional distributions let you see if variables are related:\n\nIf smoking rates are the same for males and females, gender and smoking might be independent\nIf smoking rates differ by gender, there’s a relationship between these variables\n\nWe’ll use this concept throughout the course when we talk about associations and relationships between variables."

    "text": "The “About” in Probability Interpretations\nThe Question:\n\n“For the blood pressure percentiles, all of the interpretations have statements like ‘95% of men have DBP below about 99.7 mmHg.’ Do you include the ‘about’ because it’s rounded from the R output value? Would I say ‘95% of men have DBP below 99.73824 mmHg’ or is the ‘about’ phrasing required by the actual mathematical formula?”\n\nThe Answer:\nGreat question! The “about” serves multiple purposes:\n\nReason 1: Acknowledging Model Uncertainty\nThe normal distribution is a model of reality, not reality itself. Real blood pressure distributions are only approximately normal. So when we say “about 99.7 mmHg,” we’re acknowledging that:\n\nThe model is an approximation\nReal biological data has natural variability\nThe exact cutoff is somewhat fuzzy\n\n\n\nReason 2: Practical Precision\nIn context, reporting “99.73824 mmHg” implies false precision:\n\nBlood pressure is typically measured to the nearest whole number\nThe extra decimal places suggest more certainty than we actually have\n“About 100 mmHg” or “about 99.7 mmHg” is more honest\n\n\n\nWhen to Use “About”\nUse “about” when:\n\nInterpreting real-world data (blood pressure, heights, test scores)\nRounding R output for readability\nThe context doesn’t demand exact precision\n\nYou can omit “about” when:\n\nThe problem asks for a precise calculation\nYou’re reporting the exact R output in a technical context\nThe value is exact by definition (like standardized z-scores)\n\nBottom line: Using “about” shows good statistical judgment. It acknowledges that models are approximations and that excessive precision can be misleading."

Why is probability of a single point at a continuous distribution always 0? When do you use ‘lower.tail = FALSE’?”\n\nGreat Questions! Let me break these down:\n\nWhy is P(X = exact value) = 0?\nFor continuous distributions, there are infinitely many possible values in any interval.\nThink about height:\n\nWhat’s the probability someone is exactly 170.00000… cm tall?\nNot 170.001 cm or 169.999 cm, but precisely 170?\n\nThe probability is essentially 0 because any single point is infinitesimal compared to the infinite continuum.\nImportant: This doesn’t mean it’s impossible; it just means the probability is so small (infinitely small) that it’s mathematically zero.\n\n\nWhy doesn’t it matter if we include endpoints?\nBecause P(X = exact value) = 0, these are all equivalent:\n# All of these give the SAME answer for continuous distributions:\npnorm(1.96) - pnorm(0)     # P(0 &lt; Z &lt; 1.96)\npnorm(1.96) - pnorm(0)     # P(0 ≤ Z ≤ 1.96)\npnorm(1.96) - pnorm(0)     # P(0 &lt; Z ≤ 1.96)\npnorm(1.96) - pnorm(0)     # P(0 ≤ Z &lt; 1.96)\nAdding or removing a single point (like including/excluding exactly 0 or exactly 1.96) doesn’t change the probability because each single point contributes 0.\n\n\nWhen to use lower.tail = FALSE\nAlready covered above, but the key is:\n\nlower.tail = TRUE (default): P(X ≤ value)\nlower.tail = FALSE: P(X &gt; value)"

    "section": "Normal Approximation vs. Exact Binomial",
    "text": "Normal Approximation vs. Exact Binomial\nThe Question:\n\n“Why would you use normal approximation if you can use exact (binomial) and it’s more accurate and requires fewer lines of code?”\n\nExcellent question! Here’s why:\n\nHistorical Context\nThe normal approximation was developed before computers existed.\nWhen statisticians had to calculate probabilities by hand or using printed tables:\n\nComputing \\(\\binom{1000}{487}\\) was essentially impossible\nNormal tables were available in the back of every textbook\nThe approximation was much faster and “good enough”\n\n\n\nModern Practice\nToday, with R, you’re absolutely right:\n# Exact (better!)\npbinom(487, size = 1000, prob = 0.5)\n\n# Approximation (more work, less accurate)\npnorm(487.5, mean = 500, sd = sqrt(250))\nUse the exact binomial when you can!\n\n\nWhen Normal Approximation Still Matters\nThere are a few cases where we still use it:\n\nVery large n: When n is extremely large (n &gt; 10,000), even computers can struggle with exact binomial calculations, and the normal approximation works very well\nTheoretical understanding: It helps you understand the connection between discrete and continuous distributions - a key concept in statistics\nHistorical methods: Some older statistical techniques were built on normal approximations, and understanding them helps you read older research\nConceptual foundation: The Central Limit Theorem (coming soon!) relies on this same approximation idea\n\nBottom line: In practice, prefer the exact binomial. But understanding why the normal approximation works helps build your statistical intuition.\n\n\nSummary: Exact vs. Normal Approximation (When to Use Which)\n\nExact Binomial\nUses the true binomial probability formula:\ndbinom(k, size = n, prob = p)  # P(X = k)\npbinom(k, size = n, prob = p)  # P(X ≤ k)\nAdvantages:\n\nCompletely accurate\nNo approximation error\nEasy in R\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nCan be slow for very large n\nWasn’t practical before computers\n\n\n\nNormal Approximation\nTreats the binomial as approximately normal when n is large:\n# Approximate a Binomial(n, p) with Normal(μ = np, σ² = np(1-p))\npnorm(k + 0.5, mean = n*p, sd = sqrt(n*p*(1-p)))\nAdvantages:\n\nFast even for huge n\nConnects discrete and continuous ideas\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nLess accurate (especially for small n or extreme p)\nRequires continuity correction (the + 0.5)\nMore work in R\n\n\n\nWhen is the Approximation Good?\nRules of thumb:\n\nnp ≥ 10 and n(1-p) ≥ 10\n\nOr more conservatively:\n\nnp ≥ 5 and n(1-p) ≥ 5\n\nIf these conditions aren’t met, stick with the exact binomial!\n\n\nKey takeaway\nIn this course, use the exact binomial when possible.\nWe study the normal approximation to understand why it works and how discrete and continuous distributions connect."

    "section": "Outliers in Normal Distributions",
    "text": "Outliers in Normal Distributions\nThe Question:\n\n“In a boxplot we can call any observations that fall beyond 1.5x IQR (not standard deviation) above or below the 75th/25th percentile as outliers. In normal distributions given that 95% of observances fall within 2 SDs/ z-score of 2, can we call anything beyond 2 an outlier? Beyond 3 since these are considered ‘very rare’? Or is there a different metric that can be used?”\n\nGreat Connection to Make!\nThere’s some confusion here about boxplot rules vs. z-scores, so let me clarify:\n\nBoxplot Rule (IQR Method)\nBoxplots define outliers as:\n\nBelow Q1 - 1.5×IQR\nAbove Q3 + 1.5×IQR\n\nThis is a data-driven rule that works for any distribution shape.\nNote: This is 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR), not 1.5 standard deviations!\n\n\nZ-Score Method for Outliers\nFor normal distributions, common thresholds are:\n|z| &gt; 2: Somewhat unusual (about 5% of data falls here)\n\nNot necessarily “outliers” but worth noting\nThis is where roughly 95% of data falls within ±2 SD\n\n|z| &gt; 3: Very unusual (about 0.3% of data falls here)\n\nOften considered outliers\nThese are quite rare in truly normal data\n\n|z| &gt; 4: Extremely unusual (about 0.006% of data falls here)\n\nAlmost certainly outliers or errors\nVery rare in normal distributions\n\n\n\nWhich Method to Use?\nUse the z-score method when:\n\nYou’re confident the data is approximately normal\nYou want to identify unusually extreme values\nYou’re working with standardized scores\n\nUse the IQR method when:\n\nYou don’t know if the data is normal\nThe data might be skewed\nYou want a robust method that works for any distribution\n\nBottom line: There’s no single “correct” threshold. In practice:\n\n|z| &gt; 3 is a reasonable outlier cutoff for normal data\nThe IQR method (boxplot rule) is more robust for unknown distributions\nAlways visualize your data and use domain knowledge!"
