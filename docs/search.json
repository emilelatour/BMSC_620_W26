Homework is primarily a formative assessment, meaning its purpose is to support learning rather than to assess perfection.\nThere will be regular homework assignments throughout the term. Assignments will typically include a mix of conceptual questions, interpretation, and applied work using R.\n\nGrading\nEach homework assignment will be graded on a 10-point scale using the following criteria:\n\nSubstantial completion (6 points)\nMost required parts of the assignment are attempted (approximately 75–80%). Code and written responses show a genuine effort to engage with the problems, even if some answers are incorrect.\nDemonstrated process (2 points)\nRelevant work is shown, including R code and intermediate steps where appropriate. The focus is on showing how you approached the problem rather than arriving at a perfect solution.\nInterpretation and communication (2 points)\nAnswers include written interpretation where appropriate, with an attempt to explain results in context (e.g., direction, magnitude, units, or meaning of statistical output).\n\nHomework will be graded primarily for effort, reasoning, and clarity, not strict correctness.\n\n\nFeedback and solutions\nHomework solutions will be released immediately after the submission deadline. This allows you to review the material and apply feedback while working on the next assignment, even if grading is still in progress.\nFor homework submitted on time, the TA will provide feedback on one or more problems.\nTurnaround time: Homework will be graded and returned within one week of the due date, with a target of Friday when possible.\n\n\nLate and dropped homework\n\nLate homework will be accepted for partial credit (up to 80% of the total points). Feedback will only be provided for homework submitted on time.\nThe lowest homework score will be dropped when calculating the final homework grade. HW 0 is excluded from this policy, as it is intended to ensure technical readiness for the course.\n\nThese policies are intended to provide flexibility for busy schedules while encouraging consistent engagement with the course material.",

Using R correctly\nYou should be comfortable with:\n\nChoosing the right R function (dbinom(), pbinom(), etc.)\nKnowing what each argument represents\nInterpreting the output in words\n\nFor example:\n\n“Exactly k successes” → dbinom()\n“At most k successes” → pbinom()\n\nBeing able to explain why you chose a function matters more than the numeric answer itself.\n\n\n3.

I don’t understand how it relates to other variance equations.”\n\nMy Response:\nThis is a great question.\nThe Bernoulli variance formula is not a new or special definition of variance. It comes from the same definition of variance we use for any random variable — it just simplifies nicely because a Bernoulli variable can only take two values (0 and 1).\nWhat’s important to know:\n\nVariance always measures how spread out values are around the mean\nFor a Bernoulli variable:\n\nThe mean is \\(p\\)\nOutcomes are either 0 or 1\n\nBecause of that simplicity, the general variance definition reduces to the compact result:\n\n\\[\\text{Var}(X) = p(1 - p)\\]\nYou do not need to derive this yourself. The key takeaway is the behavior of the variance:\n\nIt is largest when outcomes are most uncertain (\\(p\\) near 0.5)\n\nExample: \\(p = 0.5 \\rightarrow \\text{Var}(X) = 0.5(0.5) = 0.25\\)\n\nIt is smaller when outcomes are more predictable (\\(p\\) near 0 or 1)\n\nExample: \\(p = 0.9 \\rightarrow \\text{Var}(X) = 0.9(0.1) = 0.09\\) (less variable)\nExample: \\(p = 0.1 \\rightarrow \\text{Var}(X) = 0.1(0.9) = 0.09\\) (less variable)\n\n\nWe’ll continue to rely on this intuition and on R for calculations, rather than algebraic derivations."

I aimed to show that the probabilities don’t have to be the same for all possible outcomes.\n\nRolls of 1, 2, 3, or 4 all had the same probability: \\(1/9\\)\nA roll of 5 had a probability of \\(2/9\\)\nA roll of 6 had a probability of \\(3/9\\)\nProbabilities add to 1. Check: \\(1/9 + 1/9 + 1/9 + 1/9 + 2/9 + 3/9 = 1\\)\n\nThe dice is loaded toward higher numbers.\n\n\nThe big picture for expected value\nExpected value is best thought of as a long-run average, not a prediction of what will happen on a single trial.\n\nIt combines all possible values of a random variable\nEach value is weighted by how likely it is\nLarger values contribute more to the average than smaller values\n\nThis same idea applies to any random variable (not just dice) and is why expected value shows up throughout statistics.\nYou do not need to compute expected values by hand beyond simple examples like this. In practice, we’ll often:\n\nrely on formulas (for known distributions), or\nlet software do the calculation for us.\n\nThe important skill is understanding what expected value represents, not the mechanics of summing terms."

Think of base R as a smartphone, and packages as apps you install to do specific tasks.\n\n\nThe packages we’re using in this course\nFor this course, you need these packages installed:\n\ntidyverse (this actually installs several packages including dplyr, ggplot2, and others)\njanitor (for the adorn_ functions)\n\nThat’s it for now. I’ll let you know when we need additional packages.\n\n\nInstall once, load each session\nThis is a common source of confusion:\nInstallation (do this once per computer):\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"janitor\")\n\nLoading (do this once per R session):\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\nThink of it like this:\n\nInstalling is like downloading an app to your phone (do once)\nLoading with library() is like opening that app (do every time you restart R)\n\n\n\nWhy do we need library() every session?\nYes, you need to run library(package_name) at the start of every R session (or at the top of every script/Quarto document). This tells R which packages you want to use for this particular analysis.\nIt might seem redundant, but it’s actually helpful because:\n\nIt makes your code more reproducible (others know exactly which packages you’re using)\nIt avoids conflicts when different packages have functions with the same name\nIt keeps R’s memory usage lower by only loading what you need"

We’re ignoring gender entirely.\n\n\nConditional Distribution: Looking at relationships\nConditional distributions answer questions like: “Among males, what proportion smokes?” or “Among smokers, what proportion is male?”\nYou calculate these within a specific row or column:\n\n# Conditional distribution of smoking GIVEN gender\n# (proportions within each row)\nprop.table(smoking_data, margin = 1)\n\n        Smoker\nGender         Yes        No\n  Male   0.3750000 0.6250000\n  Female 0.5833333 0.4166667\n\n\nThis tells us:\n\nAmong males: 38% smoke, 63% don’t\nAmong females: 58% smoke, 42% don’t\n\nThis is P(Smoker | Gender) — the probability of smoking given someone’s gender.\n\n\nThe Key Difference\n\nMarginal: What’s the overall distribution of one variable? (Ignores other variables)\nConditional: What’s the distribution of one variable within a specific group of another variable? (Shows relationships)\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters\nConditional distributions let you see if variables are related:\n\nIf smoking rates are the same for males and females, gender and smoking might be independent\nIf smoking rates differ by gender, there’s a relationship between these variables\n\nWe’ll use this concept throughout the course when we talk about associations and relationships between variables."

Mean vs. standard deviation notation (\\(\\bar{x}\\), \\(s\\) vs. \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\sigma\\))\nOne question that came up was why we sometimes use symbols like μ and σ instead of x̄ (x-bar) and s, particularly when drawing or describing a normal curve.\nA helpful rule of thumb:\n\nx̄ (x-bar) and s are sample statistics — they summarize data you actually observed.\nμ (mu) and σ (sigma) are population parameters — they describe an underlying population or theoretical distribution.\n\nWhen we draw a normal curve, we often label it with μ and σ even if, in practice, we estimate those values using x̄ and s from data. This is just a convention and something we will revisit once we start formal inference.\nRelatedly, one person mentioned confusion about the “squared SD”:\n\nThe variance is the standard deviation squared.\nVariance has squared units, which is why we usually report the standard deviation instead."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome to BMSC 620: Introduction to Biostatistics. This course introduces fundamental statistical methods commonly used in the biomedical and health sciences, with an emphasis on understanding, interpretation, and clear communication rather than mathematical derivations.\nWe will begin with descriptive statistics and graphical methods for summarizing data, followed by an introduction to basic probability concepts that motivate statistical inference. Key probability and sampling distributions, including the binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions, will be introduced as tools for understanding variability and uncertainty in data.\nThe course will then cover confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for one- and two-sample problems, using both parametric and nonparametric approaches.

    "text": "Welcome to BMSC 620: Introduction to Biostatistics. This course introduces fundamental statistical methods commonly used in the biomedical and health sciences, with an emphasis on understanding, interpretation, and clear communication rather than mathematical derivations.\nWe will begin with descriptive statistics and graphical methods for summarizing data, followed by an introduction to basic probability concepts that motivate statistical inference. Key probability and sampling distributions, including the binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions, will be introduced as tools for understanding variability and uncertainty in data.\nThe course will then cover confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for one- and two-sample problems, using both parametric and nonparametric approaches. Additional topics include inference for proportions, analysis of two-way tables, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation, and simple linear regression.\nThroughout the course, emphasis will be placed on selecting appropriate statistical methods, interpreting results, and communicating conclusions in a way that is accessible to audiences without formal statistical training.

Here’s my current thinking:\n\nMany students specifically noted in the “clear points” that they found the muddy points review helpful\nReviewing them at the start helps ensure everyone’s on the same page before new material\nThat said, I hear that 20 minutes is a significant chunk of class time\n\nGoing forward, I’ll:\n\nPost muddy points to the website before class (as I do now)\nGive you time to read through them on your own first\nQuickly highlight the most common or important points in class rather than going through everything line by line\nEncourage you to come to office hours with specific questions\n\nThis should give us more time for new material while still addressing the most important confusions."

    "text": "Multiplication rule vs. conditional probability\nOne excellent question was: “I think I’m getting confused between the multiplication rule and conditional probability. Conditional probability is more ‘if this, then what about that’ and the multiplication rule is ‘if this and that’. But what is the difference, for instance between ‘positive results and has disease’ vs ‘of those who have positive results, how many have disease’? Is the difference just in the denominator?”\nThis is a great question because these concepts are closely related.\n\nConditional probability\nConditional probability answers: “Given that A happened, what’s the probability of B?”\n\\[P(B|A) = \\frac{P(A \\text{ and } B)}{P(A)}\\]\nFor example: “Of those who test positive, what proportion actually have the disease?”\nThe denominator is \\(P(\\text{positive test})\\) — we’re restricting our focus to only those who tested positive.\n\n\nMultiplication rule\nThe multiplication rule calculates the probability that both A and B happen together:\n\\[P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B|A)\\]\nFor example: “What’s the probability someone has the disease AND tests positive?”\nThis gives you the joint probability of both events occurring.\n\n\nThe relationship\nYou’re absolutely right that the denominator is the key difference:\n\nConditional probability divides by \\(P(A)\\) to find the proportion within a subset\nMultiplication rule multiplies to find the probability of both events together\n\nThey’re mathematically related — in fact, the multiplication rule comes from rearranging the conditional probability formula:\n\\[P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(B|A) \\times P(A)\\]\n\n\nExample with numbers\nSuppose:\n\n1% of people have a disease: \\(P(\\text{disease}) = 0.01\\)\nThe test is 95% accurate for those with disease: \\(P(\\text{positive}|\\text{disease}) = 0.95\\)\n\nConditional probability: Of those with disease, 95% test positive.\nMultiplication rule: The probability of having disease AND testing positive is: \\[P(\\text{disease and positive}) = 0.01 \\times 0.95 = 0.0095\\]\nSo about 0.95% of the entire population has disease and tests positive.\nThe conditional probability focuses on a rate within a subgroup. The multiplication rule gives you the overall joint probability."

This is specific to how the count() function works in dplyr.\n\nWhat count() does\nWhen you use count(), it automatically:\n\nGroups the data by the variable(s) you specify\nCounts the number of rows in each group\nAlways names the count column “n”, unless you name it something else using the name = argument (see ?dplyr::count)\n\nFor example:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\niris %&gt;%\n  count(Species)\n\n     Species  n\n1     setosa 50\n2 versicolor 50\n3  virginica 50\n\n\nThis creates a table with two columns: - Species (the grouping variable) - n (the counts — automatically named by count())\n\n\nWhy we can use “n” in mutate()\nBecause count() always creates a column called n, we can refer to it by that name in the next step:\n\niris %&gt;%\n  count(Species) %&gt;%\n  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n))\n\n     Species  n proportion\n1     setosa 50  0.3333333\n2 versicolor 50  0.3333333\n3  virginica 50  0.3333333\n\n\nThis works because: - count() created a column named n - mutate() sees that column and can use it in calculations\n\n\nWhat if you want a different name?\nYou can rename the count column if you want:\n\niris %&gt;%\n  count(Species, name = \"total\")\n\n     Species total\n1     setosa    50\n2 versicolor    50\n3  virginica    50\n\n\nNow the count column is called total instead of n.\n\n\nBottom line\nThe name n isn’t magic — it’s just the default name that count() gives to the count column. Once you know that pattern, you can use n in subsequent operations."

You can try different transformations and see what they look like, and your original data remains safe unless you explicitly choose to overwrite it."

For instance it would be nice to know a tibble is just a type of table or that a pipe was used to chain codes before we were using and manipulating them.”\nThis is very fair feedback. I introduced several tidyverse concepts quickly at the end of class without proper definitions.\n\nWhat I’ll do differently\nGoing forward, especially in next week’s data visualization class:\n\nI’ll define new terms and functions before using them in examples\nI’ll explain the “why” along with the “how”\nI’ll be more explicit about which concepts are “nice to know” vs. “essential right now”\n\n\n\nQuick definitions for this week\nFor reference:\n\nTibble: A modern version of a data frame (R’s name for a data table). It’s essentially the same thing, just with slightly nicer printing and behavior. When you see tibble, think “data table.”\nPipe (%&gt;%): An operator that passes the output of one function as input to the next function. Helps you chain operations together in a readable way.\nmutate(): Creates new columns or modifies existing ones in a data frame\ncount(): Counts the number of rows for each group and automatically creates a column called n with the counts\n\nWe’ll use all of these extensively next week, and I’ll make sure to introduce them more carefully."

I found that we were moving a bit too quickly here as well”\n“It would be helpful if we were given why we do things instead of just this does that”\n\nThese are all related to the live coding portion at the end of class.\n\nWhat I’ll adjust\nFor next week’s class (which will involve substantial R work):\n\nSlower pace: I’ll be more deliberate about typing slowly and pausing between steps\nLarger font: I’ll increase the font size in RStudio for better visibility\nMore “why”: I’ll explain the purpose of each step, not just what it does\nClear transitions: I’ll announce when we’re switching from slides to RStudio\nBuffer time: I’ll plan for time to let people catch up, especially during package installation\n\n\n\nFor those following along\nIf you’re typing along and fall behind:\n\nFocus on watching and understanding rather than typing everything in real-time\nYou can always catch up using the recorded lecture and posted code\nThe goal is understanding, not speed-typing\n\n\n\nPackage installation delays\nOne comment noted: “Installing data packages always takes a few minutes or longer if there’s an error. It seems instantaneous on your screen, and I’d hate to fall behind while waiting for something to load.”\nYou’re absolutely right. Package installation can take time, especially on slower connections or older computers.\nIn class, I often have packages already installed, which is why it looks instant.\nGoing forward:\n\nI’ll warn you when we’re about to install packages\nI’ll suggest installing key packages before class when possible\nIf installation takes time during class, I’ll pause and give everyone time to catch up"

But I’m sure when we get further it’ll all fall into place.”\nThis is a fair concern, and you’re right that things will click more as we progress.\n\nWhy we start with fundamentals\nProbability concepts like conditional probability, independence, and joint distributions are foundational to:\n\nUnderstanding statistical tests (coming soon)\nInterpreting confidence intervals and p-values\nBuilding regression models\nMaking sense of diagnostic test results (like we did with sensitivity/specificity)\n\n\n\nMoving toward applications\nOver the next few weeks, we’ll build on these fundamentals to:\n\nAnalyze real datasets\nFit models to data\nTest hypotheses\nMake predictions\n\nThe probability material we covered this week will come up repeatedly. For example:\n\nRegression coefficients are conditional means\nP-values are conditional probabilities\nConfidence intervals rely on probability distributions\n\nSo while it might feel abstract now, these concepts are the building blocks for the applied work we’ll do later in the course."
