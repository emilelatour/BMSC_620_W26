    "text": "Homework (40%)\nHomework assignments are designed to help you practice core concepts, develop familiarity with R, and build confidence interpreting statistical results. Homework is primarily a formative assessment, meaning its purpose is to support learning rather than to assess perfection.\nThere will be regular homework assignments throughout the term. Assignments will typically include a mix of conceptual questions, interpretation, and applied work using R.\n\nGrading\nEach homework assignment will be graded on a 10-point scale using the following criteria:\n\nSubstantial completion (6 points)\nMost required parts of the assignment are attempted (approximately 75–80%). Code and written responses show a genuine effort to engage with the problems, even if some answers are incorrect.\nDemonstrated process (2 points)\nRelevant work is shown, including R code and intermediate steps where appropriate. The focus is on showing how you approached the problem rather than arriving at a perfect solution.\nInterpretation and communication (2 points)\nAnswers include written interpretation where appropriate, with an attempt to explain results in context (e.g., direction, magnitude, units, or meaning of statistical output).\n\nHomework will be graded primarily for effort, reasoning, and clarity, not strict correctness.\n\n\nFeedback and solutions\nHomework solutions will be released immediately after the submission deadline. This allows you to review the material and apply feedback while working on the next assignment, even if grading is still in progress.\nFor homework submitted on time, the TA will provide feedback on one or more problems.\nTurnaround time: Homework will be graded and returned within one week of the due date, with a target of Friday when possible.\n\n\nLate and dropped homework\n\nLate homework will be accepted for partial credit (up to 80% of the total points). Feedback will only be provided for homework submitted on time.\nThe lowest homework score will be dropped when calculating the final homework grade. HW 0 is excluded from this policy, as it is intended to ensure technical readiness for the course.\n\nThese policies are intended to provide flexibility for busy schedules while encouraging consistent engagement with the course material.",

    "section": "Multiplication rule vs. conditional probability",
    "text": "Multiplication rule vs. conditional probability\nOne excellent question was: “I think I’m getting confused between the multiplication rule and conditional probability. Conditional probability is more ‘if this, then what about that’ and the multiplication rule is ‘if this and that’. But what is the difference, for instance between ‘positive results and has disease’ vs ‘of those who have positive results, how many have disease’? Is the difference just in the denominator?”\nThis is a great question because these concepts are closely related.\n\nConditional probability\nConditional probability answers: “Given that A happened, what’s the probability of B?”\n\\[P(B|A) = \\frac{P(A \\text{ and } B)}{P(A)}\\]\nFor example: “Of those who test positive, what proportion actually have the disease?”\nThe denominator is \\(P(\\text{positive test})\\) — we’re restricting our focus to only those who tested positive.\n\n\nMultiplication rule\nThe multiplication rule calculates the probability that both A and B happen together:\n\\[P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B|A)\\]\nFor example: “What’s the probability someone has the disease AND tests positive?”\nThis gives you the joint probability of both events occurring.\n\n\nThe relationship\nYou’re absolutely right that the denominator is the key difference:\n\nConditional probability divides by \\(P(A)\\) to find the proportion within a subset\nMultiplication rule multiplies to find the probability of both events together\n\nThey’re mathematically related — in fact, the multiplication rule comes from rearranging the conditional probability formula:\n\\[P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(B|A) \\times P(A)\\]\n\n\nExample with numbers\nSuppose: - 1% of people have a disease: \\(P(\\text{disease}) = 0.01\\) - The test is 95% accurate for those with disease: \\(P(\\text{positive}|\\text{disease}) = 0.95\\)\nConditional probability: Of those with disease, 95% test positive.\nMultiplication rule: The probability of having disease AND testing positive is: \\[P(\\text{disease and positive}) = 0.01 \\times 0.95 = 0.0095\\]\nSo about 0.95% of the entire population has disease and tests positive.\nThe conditional probability focuses on a rate within a subgroup. The multiplication rule gives you the overall joint probability."

This is specific to how the count() function works in dplyr.\n\nWhat count() does\nWhen you use count(), it automatically:\n\nGroups the data by the variable(s) you specify\nCounts the number of rows in each group\nAlways names the count column “n”, unless you name it something else using the name = argument (see ?dplyr::count)\n\nFor example:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\niris %&gt;%\n  count(Species)\n\n     Species  n\n1     setosa 50\n2 versicolor 50\n3  virginica 50\n\n\nThis creates a table with two columns: - Species (the grouping variable) - n (the counts — automatically named by count())\n\n\nWhy we can use “n” in mutate()\nBecause count() always creates a column called n, we can refer to it by that name in the next step:\n\niris %&gt;%\n  count(Species) %&gt;%\n  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n))\n\n     Species  n proportion\n1     setosa 50  0.3333333\n2 versicolor 50  0.3333333\n3  virginica 50  0.3333333\n\n\nThis works because: - count() created a column named n - mutate() sees that column and can use it in calculations\n\n\nWhat if you want a different name?\nYou can rename the count column if you want:\n\niris %&gt;%\n  count(Species, name = \"total\")\n\n     Species total\n1     setosa    50\n2 versicolor    50\n3  virginica    50\n\n\nNow the count column is called total instead of n.\n\n\nBottom line\nThe name n isn’t magic — it’s just the default name that count() gives to the count column. Once you know that pattern, you can use n in subsequent operations."

    "text": "Does mutate() edit your actual data?\nOne question was: “I’m wondering when you use the mutate function, are you editing your actual data table, or just seeing what a new column would look like.”\nExcellent question! This is important to understand for working safely with data in R.\n\nShort answer: No, it doesn’t modify your original data\nWhen you use mutate() (or most data manipulation functions in R), it creates a new data frame with the changes. It does not modify the original data frame unless you explicitly overwrite it.\n\n\nExample\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Original data\nhead(iris)\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width

For instance it would be nice to know a tibble is just a type of table or that a pipe was used to chain codes before we were using and manipulating them.”\nThis is very fair feedback. I introduced several tidyverse concepts quickly at the end of class without proper definitions.\n\nWhat I’ll do differently\nGoing forward, especially in next week’s data visualization class:\n\nI’ll define new terms and functions before using them in examples\nI’ll explain the “why” along with the “how”\nI’ll be more explicit about which concepts are “nice to know” vs. “essential right now”\n\n\n\nQuick definitions for this week\nFor reference:\n\nTibble: A modern version of a data frame (R’s name for a data table). It’s essentially the same thing, just with slightly nicer printing and behavior. When you see tibble, think “data table.”\nPipe (%&gt;%): An operator that passes the output of one function as input to the next function. Helps you chain operations together in a readable way.\nmutate(): Creates new columns or modifies existing ones in a data frame\ncount(): Counts the number of rows for each group and automatically creates a column called n with the counts\n\nWe’ll use all of these extensively next week, and I’ll make sure to introduce them more carefully."

For example:\n\nRegression coefficients are conditional means\nP-values are conditional probabilities\nConfidence intervals rely on probability distributions\n\nSo while it might feel abstract now, these concepts are the building blocks for the applied work we’ll do later in the course."

This course introduces fundamental statistical methods commonly used in the biomedical and health sciences, with an emphasis on understanding, interpretation, and clear communication rather than mathematical derivations.\nWe will begin with descriptive statistics and graphical methods for summarizing data, followed by an introduction to basic probability concepts that motivate statistical inference. Key probability and sampling distributions, including the binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions, will be introduced as tools for understanding variability and uncertainty in data.\nThe course will then cover confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for one- and two-sample problems, using both parametric and nonparametric approaches. Additional topics include inference for proportions, analysis of two-way tables, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation, and simple linear regression.\nThroughout the course, emphasis will be placed on selecting appropriate statistical methods, interpreting results, and communicating conclusions in a way that is accessible to audiences without formal statistical training.

Mean vs. standard deviation notation (\\(\\bar{x}\\), \\(s\\) vs. \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\sigma\\))\nOne question that came up was why we sometimes use symbols like μ and σ instead of x̄ (x-bar) and s, particularly when drawing or describing a normal curve.\nA helpful rule of thumb:\n\nx̄ (x-bar) and s are sample statistics — they summarize data you actually observed.\nμ (mu) and σ (sigma) are population parameters — they describe an underlying population or theoretical distribution.\n\nWhen we draw a normal curve, we often label it with μ and σ even if, in practice, we estimate those values using x̄ and s from data. This is just a convention and something we will revisit once we start formal inference.\nRelatedly, one person mentioned confusion about the “squared SD”:\n\nThe variance is the standard deviation squared.\nVariance has squared units, which is why we usually report the standard deviation instead."

(Ignores other variables)\nConditional: What’s the distribution of one variable within a specific group of another variable? (Shows relationships)\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters\nConditional distributions let you see if variables are related:\n\nIf smoking rates are the same for males and females, gender and smoking might be independent\nIf smoking rates differ by gender, there’s a relationship between these variables\n\nWe’ll use this concept throughout the course when we talk about associations and relationships between variables."

When you load both, R will warn you:\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n    select\nThis means the select() from the package loaded second (MASS) will be used by default.\n\n\nHow to handle this\nIf you need a specific version of a function, you can specify the package explicitly:\n\ndplyr::select()  # uses dplyr's version\nMASS::select()   # uses MASS's version\n\n\n\nBottom line\n\nTrue package incompatibility (where one package actually breaks another) is uncommon\nFunction name conflicts are more common but easy to manage\nR will warn you when conflicts occur\nFor this course, the packages we use are all compatible with each other\n\nDon’t worry about this as you’re getting started. If a conflict comes up, we’ll address it together."

These ideas are closely related, and the differences are mostly about how groups are formed and who gets sampled.\nA helpful way to think about this is to ask two questions:\n\nWhy are the groups defined?\nWho do we actually sample?\n\nStratified sampling\n\nGroups (called strata) are formed based on shared characteristics that matter to the research question.\nIndividuals within each stratum are relatively similar.\nWe then randomly sample some individuals from every stratum.\n\nGoal: Ensure representation from all important subgroups.\nExample (animal study):\nYou are studying hormone levels in mice and know sex affects the outcome.\n\nCreate strata by sex (male, female).\nRandomly sample mice from each sex group.\n\nCluster sampling\n\nGroups (called clusters) are formed based on natural or logistical groupings.\nIndividuals within a cluster are often diverse.\nWe randomly select entire clusters, then include all individuals within them.\n\nGoal: Reduce cost or effort when sampling individuals directly is difficult.\nExample (animal study):\nYou are studying lab mice housed in cages.\n\nTreat each cage as a cluster.\nRandomly select some cages.\nMeasure all mice in the selected cages.\n\nMultistage sampling\n\nSampling happens in steps.\nFirst, clusters are randomly selected.\nThen, individuals are randomly sampled within those selected clusters.\n\nGoal: Combine logistical convenience with random sampling.\nExample (animal study):\n\nStage 1: Randomly select cages.\nStage 2: Randomly select mice within each selected cage.\n\nYou can think of multistage sampling as layering familiar sampling ideas together."

    "text": "2. Why would some clusters be more likely to be selected?\nOne question that came up was why certain clusters might have a higher chance of selection in multistage sampling.\nThis was a place where I misspoke in class (around the 57 mimute mark of the recording), so I want to clarify.\nFor the types of sampling designs we focus on in this course (and in the textbook), clusters are usually selected at random, with each cluster having the same probability of being chosen. You should generally think of cluster sampling as treating each cluster equally at the selection stage.\nMore complex designs where clusters have different selection probabilities do exist, but we will not be focusing on those, and we will not be getting into weighting in this course.\nTo help reinforce the distinction, here is a contrast between stratified sampling and cluster sampling.\nStratified sampling\n\nThe population is divided into strata such that units within each stratum are similar with respect to the variable(s) of interest.\nA random sample is then taken within each stratum.\nGoal: reduce variability within strata and ensure representation of important subgroups.\nResult:\n\nLow variability within strata\nHigher variability between strata\n\n\nCluster sampling\n\nThe population is divided into clusters such that:\n\nunits within a cluster are diverse, and\n\nclusters themselves are similar to one another.\n\n\nA random sample of clusters is selected, and then all units (or many units) within the selected clusters are included.\nGoal: improve practicality or reduce cost when sampling individuals directly is difficult.\nAs described in the textbook:\n\nHigh case-to-case variability within clusters\nClusters are similar to each other\n\n\nIn short:\n\nStratified sampling: simple random sample of units within every group\nCluster sampling: simple random sample of entire groups\n\nThank you for raising this! It was a good catch, and this clarification will help going forward."
