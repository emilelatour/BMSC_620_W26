    "text": "BMSC 620: Introduction to Biostatistics\n\nWinter 2026\nWelcome to BMSC 620: Introduction to Biostatistics. This course introduces fundamental statistical methods commonly used in the biomedical and health sciences, with an emphasis on understanding, interpretation, and clear communication rather than mathematical derivations.\nWe will begin with descriptive statistics and graphical methods for summarizing data, followed by an introduction to basic probability concepts that motivate statistical inference. Key probability and sampling distributions, including the binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions, will be introduced as tools for understanding variability and uncertainty in data.\nThe course will then cover confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for one- and two-sample problems, using both parametric and nonparametric approaches. Additional topics include inference for proportions, analysis of two-way tables, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation, and simple linear regression.\nThroughout the course, emphasis will be placed on selecting appropriate statistical methods, interpreting results, and communicating conclusions in a way that is accessible to audiences without formal statistical training. Students will gain hands-on experience using statistical software (R) for basic data management, visualization, and interpretation of output generated by statistical analyses, as well as for building reproducible analytical workflows.\n\n\n\nInstructor\n Emile Latour, MS\n RJH 4320\n latour@ohsu.edu\n\n\nOffice Hours\nEmile  Thursday, 1:00 – 2:00 PM\n\n\nCourse details\n Mondays, Wednesdays\n January 5 – March 20\n 9:00 AM – 11:30 AM\n In-person, RJH 4320\nNote: Class will meet in MAC 3198 on January 21 only.\n\n\nContacting me\nE-mail is the best way to get in contact with me. I will try to respond to all course-related e-mails within 24 hours Monday-Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n View the source on GitHub"
