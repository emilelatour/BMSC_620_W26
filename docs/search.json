    "text": "Homework (40%)\nHomework assignments are designed to help you practice core concepts, develop familiarity with R, and build confidence interpreting statistical results. Homework is primarily a formative assessment, meaning its purpose is to support learning rather than to assess perfection.\nThere will be regular homework assignments throughout the term. Assignments will typically include a mix of conceptual questions, interpretation, and applied work using R.\n\nGrading\nEach homework assignment will be graded on a 10-point scale using the following criteria:\n\nSubstantial completion (6 points)\nMost required parts of the assignment are attempted (approximately 75–80%). Code and written responses show a genuine effort to engage with the problems, even if some answers are incorrect.\nDemonstrated process (2 points)\nRelevant work is shown, including R code and intermediate steps where appropriate. The focus is on showing how you approached the problem rather than arriving at a perfect solution.\nInterpretation and communication (2 points)\nAnswers include written interpretation where appropriate, with an attempt to explain results in context (e.g., direction, magnitude, units, or meaning of statistical output).\n\nHomework will be graded primarily for effort, reasoning, and clarity, not strict correctness.\n\n\nFeedback\nFor homework submitted on time, the TA will provide feedback on one or more problems. Solutions will be posted after the due date so that you can review your work and identify areas for improvement.\n\n\nLate and dropped homework\n\nLate homework will be accepted for partial credit (up to 80% of the total points). Feedback will only be provided for homework submitted on time.\nThe lowest homework score will be dropped when calculating the final homework grade. HW 0 is excluded from this policy, as it is intended to ensure technical readiness for the course.\n\nThese policies are intended to provide flexibility for busy schedules while encouraging consistent engagement with the course material.",

This course introduces fundamental statistical methods commonly used in the biomedical and health sciences, with an emphasis on understanding, interpretation, and clear communication rather than mathematical derivations.\nWe will begin with descriptive statistics and graphical methods for summarizing data, followed by an introduction to basic probability concepts that motivate statistical inference. Key probability and sampling distributions, including the binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions, will be introduced as tools for understanding variability and uncertainty in data.\nThe course will then cover confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for one- and two-sample problems, using both parametric and nonparametric approaches. Additional topics include inference for proportions, analysis of two-way tables, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation, and simple linear regression.\nThroughout the course, emphasis will be placed on selecting appropriate statistical methods, interpreting results, and communicating conclusions in a way that is accessible to audiences without formal statistical training. Students will gain hands-on experience using statistical software (R) for basic data management, visualization, and interpretation of output generated by statistical analyses, as well as for building reproducible analytical workflows.\nCourse materials and structure for BMSC 620 were developed by Emile Latour and informed by prior offerings taught by Meike Niederhausen and Nicky Wakim.

    "text": "How are data stored, how do we use them?\n\nOften, data are in an Excel sheet, or a plain text file (.csv, .txt)\n.csv files open in Excel automatically, but actually are plain text\nUsually, columns are variables/measures and rows are observations (i.e. a person’s measurements)\n\nData in R\n\nWe can import data from many file types, including .csv, .txt., and .xlsx\n\nWe will cover this on a later date\n\nOnce imported, R typically stores data as data frames, or tibbles if using the tidyverse package (more on this later).\n\nFor our purposes, these are essentially the same, and I will tend to use the terms interchangeably.\nThese are examples of what we call object types in R."
