    "text": "Homework (40%)\nHomework assignments are designed to help you practice core concepts, develop familiarity with R, and build confidence interpreting statistical results. Homework is primarily a formative assessment, meaning its purpose is to support learning rather than to assess perfection.\nThere will be regular homework assignments throughout the term. Assignments will typically include a mix of conceptual questions, interpretation, and applied work using R.\n\nGrading\nEach homework assignment will be graded on a 10-point scale using the following criteria:\n\nSubstantial completion (6 points)\nMost required parts of the assignment are attempted (approximately 75–80%). Code and written responses show a genuine effort to engage with the problems, even if some answers are incorrect.\nDemonstrated process (2 points)\nRelevant work is shown, including R code and intermediate steps where appropriate. The focus is on showing how you approached the problem rather than arriving at a perfect solution.\nInterpretation and communication (2 points)\nAnswers include written interpretation where appropriate, with an attempt to explain results in context (e.g., direction, magnitude, units, or meaning of statistical output).\n\nHomework will be graded primarily for effort, reasoning, and clarity, not strict correctness.\n\n\nFeedback and solutions\nHomework solutions will be released immediately after the submission deadline. This allows you to review the material and apply feedback while working on the next assignment, even if grading is still in progress.\nFor homework submitted on time, the TA will provide feedback on one or more problems.\nTurnaround time: Homework will be graded and returned within one week of the due date, with a target of Friday when possible.\n\n\nLate and dropped homework\n\nLate homework will be accepted for partial credit (up to 80% of the total points). Feedback will only be provided for homework submitted on time.\nThe lowest homework score will be dropped when calculating the final homework grade. HW 0 is excluded from this policy, as it is intended to ensure technical readiness for the course.\n\nThese policies are intended to provide flexibility for busy schedules while encouraging consistent engagement with the course material.",

This course introduces fundamental statistical methods commonly used in the biomedical and health sciences, with an emphasis on understanding, interpretation, and clear communication rather than mathematical derivations.\nWe will begin with descriptive statistics and graphical methods for summarizing data, followed by an introduction to basic probability concepts that motivate statistical inference. Key probability and sampling distributions, including the binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions, will be introduced as tools for understanding variability and uncertainty in data.\nThe course will then cover confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for one- and two-sample problems, using both parametric and nonparametric approaches. Additional topics include inference for proportions, analysis of two-way tables, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation, and simple linear regression.\nThroughout the course, emphasis will be placed on selecting appropriate statistical methods, interpreting results, and communicating conclusions in a way that is accessible to audiences without formal statistical training. Students will gain hands-on experience using statistical software (R) for basic data management, visualization, and interpretation of output generated by statistical analyses, as well as for building reproducible analytical workflows.\nCourse materials and structure for BMSC 620 were developed by Emile Latour and informed by prior offerings taught by Meike Niederhausen and Nicky Wakim.

    "text": "1. Stratified sampling vs. cluster sampling vs. multistage sampling\nThis was the most common point of confusion, which is very normal. These ideas are closely related, and the differences are mostly about how groups are formed and who gets sampled.\nA helpful way to think about this is to ask two questions:\n\nWhy are the groups defined?\nWho do we actually sample?\n\nStratified sampling\n\nGroups (called strata) are formed based on shared characteristics that matter to the research question.\nIndividuals within each stratum are relatively similar.\nWe then randomly sample some individuals from every stratum.\n\nGoal: Ensure representation from all important subgroups.\nExample (animal study):\nYou are studying hormone levels in mice and know sex affects the outcome.\n\nCreate strata by sex (male, female).\nRandomly sample mice from each sex group.\n\nCluster sampling\n\nGroups (called clusters) are formed based on natural or logistical groupings.\nIndividuals within a cluster are often diverse.\nWe randomly select entire clusters, then include all individuals within them.\n\nGoal: Reduce cost or effort when sampling individuals directly is difficult.\nExample (animal study):\nYou are studying lab mice housed in cages.\n\nTreat each cage as a cluster.\nRandomly select some cages.\nMeasure all mice in the selected cages.\n\nMultistage sampling\n\nSampling happens in steps.\nFirst, clusters are randomly selected.\nThen, individuals are randomly sampled within those selected clusters.\n\nGoal: Combine logistical convenience with random sampling.\nExample (animal study):\n\nStage 1: Randomly select cages.\nStage 2: Randomly select mice within each selected cage.\n\nYou can think of multistage sampling as layering familiar sampling ideas together."

    "text": "2. Why would some clusters be more likely to be selected?\nOne question that came up was why certain clusters might have a higher chance of selection in multistage sampling.\nThis was a place where I misspoke in class (around the 57 mimute mark of the recording), so I want to clarify.\nFor the types of sampling designs we focus on in this course (and in the textbook), clusters are usually selected at random, with each cluster having the same probability of being chosen. You should generally think of cluster sampling as treating each cluster equally at the selection stage.\nMore complex designs where clusters have different selection probabilities do exist, but we will not be focusing on those, and we will not be getting into weighting in this course.\nTo help reinforce the distinction, here is a contrast between stratified sampling and cluster sampling.\nStratified sampling\n\nThe population is divided into strata such that units within each stratum are similar with respect to the variable(s) of interest.\nA random sample is then taken within each stratum.\nGoal: reduce variability within strata and ensure representation of important subgroups.\nResult:\n\nLow variability within strata\nHigher variability between strata\n\n\nCluster sampling\n\nThe population is divided into clusters such that:\n\nunits within a cluster are diverse, and\n\nclusters themselves are similar to one another.\n\n\nA random sample of clusters is selected, and then all units (or many units) within the selected clusters are included.\nGoal: improve practicality or reduce cost when sampling individuals directly is difficult.\nAs described in the textbook:\n\nHigh case-to-case variability within clusters\nClusters are similar to each other\n\n\nIn short:\n\nStratified sampling: simple random sample of units within every group\nCluster sampling: simple random sample of entire groups\n\nThank you for raising this! It was a good catch, and this clarification will help going forward."
