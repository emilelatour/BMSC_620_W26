## Grading rubric (10 points)

Each homework is graded on a 10-point scale:

- **Substantial completion (6 points)**: ~75-80% of parts attempted with a genuine effort
- **Demonstrated process (2 points)**: relevant work shown; R code included when used
- **Interpretation and communication (2 points)**: brief written interpretation in context when appropriate

Homework is graded primarily for **effort, reasoning, and clarity**, not strict correctness.

### Late homework

Late homework is accepted for **partial credit (up to 80% of total points)**.

Feedback is provided **only** for homework submitted on time.
