**Brief professor statement:** As a professor, my main goal is to instill a growth mindset into my students. Growth mindset means we are NOT stuck in our abilities or knowledge, and that we all can grow with effort, feedback, and learning from mistakes! This course aims to be as transparent as possible. I want you to understand my motivation for assessments, questions, and lessons. I also want those assessments to be clear, so please ask for clarification whenever needed.


## Teaching Assistants

I am very excited to have *Hannah Cunningham* and *Sophia Mann* serve as our TAs for the quarter! Please see the main page for their office hours.
