## Thanks for the feedback

Thank you to everyone who submitted post-class feedback. Below I address the main points that came up as muddy or unclear after our first lecture.


## 1. Stratified sampling vs. cluster sampling vs. multistage sampling

This was the most common point of confusion, which is very normal. These ideas are closely related, and the differences are mostly about **how groups are formed** and **who gets sampled**.

A helpful way to think about this is to ask two questions:

1.	Why are the groups defined?
2.	Who do we actually sample?

**Stratified sampling**

- Groups (called *strata*) are formed based on **shared characteristics that matter to the research question**.
- Individuals within each stratum are relatively similar.
- We then randomly sample **some individuals from every stratum**.

**Goal**: Ensure representation from all important subgroups.

**Example (animal study)**:

You are studying hormone levels in mice and know sex affects the outcome.

- Create strata by sex (male, female).
- Randomly sample mice from *each sex* group.

**Cluster sampling**

- Groups (called *clusters*) are formed based on **natural or logistical groupings**.
- Individuals within a cluster are often diverse.
- We randomly select **entire clusters**, then include all individuals within them.

**Goal**: Reduce cost or effort when sampling individuals directly is difficult.

**Example (animal study)**:

You are studying lab mice housed in cages.

- Treat each cage as a cluster.
- Randomly select some cages.
- Measure all mice in the selected cages.

**Multistage sampling**

- Sampling happens in steps.
- First, clusters are randomly selected.
- Then, individuals are randomly sampled within those selected clusters.

**Goal**: Combine logistical convenience with random sampling.

**Example (animal study)**:

- Stage 1: Randomly select cages.
- Stage 2: Randomly select mice within each selected cage.

You can think of multistage sampling as layering familiar sampling ideas together.

## 2. Why would some clusters be more likely to be selected?

One question that came up was why certain clusters might have a higher chance of selection in **multistage sampling**.

This was a place where I misspoke in class (around the 57 mimute mark of the recording), so I want to clarify.

For the types of sampling designs we focus on in this course (and in the textbook), **clusters are usually selected at random**, with **each cluster having the same probability of being chosen**. You should generally think of cluster sampling as treating each cluster equally at the selection stage.

More complex designs where clusters have different selection probabilities *do exist*, but we will not be focusing on those, and we will not be getting into weighting in this course.

To help reinforce the distinction, here is a contrast between stratified sampling and cluster sampling.

**Stratified sampling**

- The population is divided into **strata** such that units within each stratum are similar with respect to the variable(s) of interest.
- A random sample is then taken **within each stratum**.
- Goal: reduce variability *within* strata and ensure representation of important subgroups.
- Result:
  - Low variability within strata
  - Higher variability between strata

**Cluster sampling**

- The population is divided into **clusters** such that:
  - units *within a cluster are diverse*, and
	- clusters themselves are similar to one another.
- A random sample of clusters is selected, and then **all units (or many units)** within the selected clusters are included.
- Goal: improve practicality or reduce cost when sampling individuals directly is difficult.
- As described in the textbook:
  - High case-to-case variability within clusters
  - Clusters are similar to each other

In short:

- **Stratified sampling**: simple random sample of units *within every group*
- **Cluster sampling**: simple random sample of *entire groups*

Thank you for raising this! It was a good catch, and this clarification will help going forward.


## 3. Nominal vs. ordinal variables

A few people mentioned that variable types felt rushed near the end.

A quick reminder:

- **Nominal variables**: categories with no natural order (e.g., species, blood type).
- **Ordinal variables**: categories with a meaningful order, but unclear spacing (e.g., mild / moderate / severe).

We will return to variable types repeatedly throughout the course, especially when we start visualizing data and choosing analyses.

## 4. R, Quarto, and .qmd files

Several people noted that the introduction to R and .qmd files felt intimidating, especially for those new to R.

That reaction is expected.

For now, the key idea is:

- A `.qmd` file is a document that mixes **text and code**.
- Rendering turns it into something readable (like an HTML file).

Homework 0 is designed to be:

- low-stakes,
- guided,
- and focused on setup rather than programming.

You are not expected to understand R deeply yet.

## 5. Homework submission and course logistics

A few people asked how homework is submitted and how lecture material connects to the textbook.

- The **course website** is your main hub for slides, recordings, and instructions.
- **Sakai** is used for submitting assignments and checking grades.
- Lectures and the textbook are meant to complement each other; sometimes lecture will preview ideas, other times it will reinforce them.

This will feel clearer once you’ve completed your first homework.

## Final note

If something still feels muddy after this clarification, that’s okay. Many concepts in statistics become clearer only after you see them used multiple times.

Please keep using the post-class check-ins. They are genuinely helpful for guiding what we slow down on or revisit.
