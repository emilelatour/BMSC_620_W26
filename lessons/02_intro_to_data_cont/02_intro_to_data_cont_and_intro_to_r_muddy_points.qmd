## Thanks for the feedback

Thank you to everyone who submitted post-class feedback. Overall, the material from our first week was reported as quite clear, which is great to hear. Below I address the main points that came up as muddy or unclear.

---

## 1. Mean vs. standard deviation notation ($\bar{x}$, $s$ vs. $\mu$, $\sigma$)

One question that came up was why we sometimes use symbols like **μ** and **σ** instead of **x̄** (x-bar) and **s**, particularly when drawing or describing a normal curve.

A helpful rule of thumb:

- **x̄ (x-bar)** and **s** are *sample statistics* — they summarize data you actually observed.
- **μ (mu)** and **σ (sigma)** are *population parameters* — they describe an underlying population or theoretical distribution.

When we draw a normal curve, we often label it with **μ** and **σ** even if, in practice, we estimate those values using **x̄** and **s** from data. This is just a convention and something we will revisit once we start formal inference.

Relatedly, one person mentioned confusion about the “squared SD”:

- The **variance** is the standard deviation squared.
- Variance has squared units, which is why we usually *report* the standard deviation instead.

## 2. Markdown vs. comments in `.qmd` files

A few questions came up about when to use different symbols in Quarto files:

- `#` inside an R code chunk is a **code comment** (for humans, not output).
- `<!-- -->` is an **HTML comment** in the markdown text (also not shown in output).
- `>` creates a **block quote**, which *does* appear in the rendered document.

In short:
- Use comments (`#` or `<!-- -->`) for notes to yourself or graders.
- Use block quotes (`>`) when you want text to appear as part of the document.

## 3. Source vs. Visual editor

Some people weren’t sure why we would use the **Source** editor at this point.

For now, think of this as:

- **Visual editor**: helpful for getting started, especially if you’re new.
- **Source editor**: shows the underlying text and structure of the document.

They are just two ways of editing the *same* file. Over time, you may find that the Source editor gives you more control, but you are free to use whichever view feels more comfortable right now.

## 4. Is `.qmd` something people actually use?

Yes — documents that combine code, text, and output are very common in statistics and data analysis.

Some people use:
- Quarto (`.qmd`)
- R Markdown (`.Rmd`)
- Jupyter notebooks
- Similar tools in Python or other languages

We are using Quarto in this course because it supports reproducible analysis and clear communication in one place. The skills you learn here will transfer easily to other tools.

## 5. Pace and in-class practice

A small number of people mentioned that the R portion felt a little fast, especially for those completely new to R.

That is expected early on. The goal of in-class practice is **exposure**, not mastery in the moment. It’s okay if you don’t finish everything during class — we’ll continue to reinforce these ideas through homework and repeated use.

---

## Final note

If something still feels muddy after this clarification, that’s okay. Many ideas in statistics (and in R) only become clear after you see them used multiple times.

Please keep using the post-class check-ins. They are genuinely helpful for guiding what we revisit or slow down on.
