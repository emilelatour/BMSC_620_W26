Today / next work session
	1.	syllabus.qmd (functional, not perfect)

After that
2) materials.qmd (hub with links + placeholders)

Then
3) instructors.qmd (clean, complete, calm)


   Okabe–Ito color system
   ============================ */
$oi-blue:        #0072B2;  /* headings / structure */
$oi-green:       #009E73;  /* links */
$oi-black:       #000000;
$oi-grey:        #999999;
$oi-orange:      #E69F00;  /* for warnings/notes */
$oi-yellow:      #F0E442;  /* for highlights */

Colors and Hex Codes
Black: #000000
Orange: #E69F00
Sky Blue: #56B4E9
Bluish Green: #009E73
Yellow: #F0E442
Blue: #0072B2
Vermilion: #D55E00
Reddish Purple: #CC79A7
Grey: #999999 (or sometimes black is replaced with grey in 8-color sets) 


Then:
	•	use &nbsp; inside slides to separate sections
	•	use <br> after headers to separate title from content

That gives you a clean mental model:
	•	header spacing = <br>
	•	content spacing = &nbsp;


En Dash –





::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
10^2
3 ^ 7
6/9
9-43
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
4^3-2* 7+9 /2
```

The equation above is computed as $$4^3 − (2 \cdot 7) + \frac{9}{2}$$

I need helping making this Wednesdays lecture on the Normal Distribution and maybe the Poisson Distribution. Attached are Nicky and Meike's slides. Nicky originally did them both in one lecture on the same day. Then she split them up. Meike's is in one lecture still



The normal distribution is super important. The Poisson -- I'd really just like for them to recognize it and to know when they might need it (counts and rates). Or maybe its an optional recorded lecture. I'm not sure what;s best. But the Normal needs to be covered for sure. I'd take your thoughts and advice.



The book covers the normal dist on pages 152-167. And the Poisson on pages 168-169
