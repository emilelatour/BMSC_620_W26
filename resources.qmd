This page contains links to course materials, software setup, and shared resources. I will update it throughout the term.

## Textbook and readings

### Primary textbook

*Introductory Statistics for the Life and Biomedical Sciences* by Julie Vu and David Harrington

- The textbook website is <https://openintro.org/book/biostat/>
- The full PDF is free (with an optional contribution).
- A tablet-friendly PDF version with smaller margins is also available and may be easier to read.

### Supplementary reading (optional)

- *An Introduction to R* ([free pdf](http://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html))

## Course platforms

### Sakai

Assignments, submissions, and grades will be managed through [Sakai](https://sakai.ohsu.edu/), OHSU's learning management system.

Links to Sakai assignments will be provided on this website.

### Shared course folder (OneDrive)

A shared OneDrive folder will be used to distribute datasets, handouts, and other course files that do not live directly on this website.

- The folder will include datasets used in class and on homework.
- Files will be organized by topic or week.
- Links to specific files may also appear on the Schedule page.

[Link to class OneDrive folder](ADD-LINK-HERE) **NOT SET UP YET**

### Office hours platform

Webex will be used for virtual office hours when applicable.

To help sessions run smoothly:

- Please stay muted until you want to ask a question.
- Use the chat to indicate when you have a question.
- Video is encouraged but not required.

## Statistical software

We will use **R** and **RStudio** for homework assignments and in-class examples. 

**Quarto** will be used for creating reproducible reports.

### Installation

Please install the following software:

1. R <https://www.r-project.org/>
2. RStudio Desktop <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
3. Quarto <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>

Helpful installation documentation is available here: <https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html>

Also, this [handout](/resources/R info.pdf) by Meike Neiderhausen which contains some good additional resources for R.

I encourage you to install these before the first class. We will reserve time early in the term to troubleshoot installation issues.

If you run into problems, please email me and include:

- Your operating system (Windows or Mac)
- The full error message (copy/paste or screenshot)
- What you have already tried

### Additional R resources (optional)

These resources are not required, but may be helpful if you want extra practice or alternative explanations.
