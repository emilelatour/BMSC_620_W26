# Purpose

This guide summarizes what a complete statistical interpretation looks like in this course. Use it as a checklist when writing up results for homework and exams.

The goal is not to produce a rigid formula. It is to communicate your findings clearly enough that someone unfamiliar with your analysis could understand what you did, what you found, and what it means.

::: {.callout-tip}
When in doubt, ask yourself: *Could someone read this and know exactly what test I ran, what I found, and what conclusion I drew?* If yes, you are in good shape.

# Step 1: State Your Hypotheses

Always state your hypotheses explicitly before conducting a test. Do not leave the reader to infer them from your conclusion.

Hypotheses should be stated in terms of a **population parameter**, not sample statistics.

**Examples:**

$$H_0: p = 0.5 \quad \text{versus} \quad H_A: p \neq 0.5$$

$$H_0: p_1 = p_2 \quad \text{versus} \quad H_A: p_1 \neq p_2$$

$$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 \quad \text{versus} \quad H_A: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2$$

$$H_0: \text{There is no association between } X \text{ and } Y \quad \text{versus} \quad H_A: \text{There is an association between } X \text{ and } Y$$

For regression contexts:

$$H_0: \beta_1 = 0 \quad \text{versus} \quad H_A: \beta_1 \neq 0$$

# Step 2: Report the Key Results

A complete write-up includes all of the following:

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Checklist**

- [ ] The **test statistic** and its type (e.g., $z$, $t$, $\chi^2$)
- [ ] The **$p$-value**, rounded to 3 decimal places (e.g., $p = 0.032$). If the $p$-value is less than 0.001, it is acceptable to report $p < 0.001$ rather than the exact value.
- [ ] The **estimate of interest** with units (e.g., a proportion, mean difference, odds ratio)
- [ ] A **95% confidence interval** for that estimate, with units
- [ ] The **$\alpha$ level** used for the decision
- [ ] A **conclusion** about the null hypothesis
:::

**A note on transformed coefficients:** Do not report untransformed coefficients when the parameter of interest is on a different scale. For example, in logistic regression, report the **odds ratio** (and its 95% CI), not the log odds.

# Step 3: Write Your Conclusion Carefully

Two important rules:

1. **We do not "accept" the null hypothesis.** We either *reject* $H_0$ or *fail to reject* $H_0$. A non-significant result does not prove the null is true --- it means we did not find sufficient evidence against it. The study may simply have been underpowered.

2. **Frame your conclusion in the context of the problem.** Don't just say "we reject $H_0$." Say what that means for the research question, in plain language, with appropriate hedging.

# A Complete Example

The following example illustrates all of the required components. Each label **(a)** through **(d)** corresponds to a checklist item.

---

> In a double-blind randomized clinical trial, there was a non-significant difference between the proportion of patients who died in the treatment and control groups (z-test, $z = -1.90$; $p = 0.058$) **(a)**.
>
> The proportion of patients who died in the control group was 8.1% (95% CI: 6.1% to 10.0%), and the proportion who died in the treatment group was 5.6% (95% CI: 3.9% to 7.3%). The proportion of patients who died in the treatment group was 2.5 percentage points lower (95% CI: 0.1 percentage points higher to 5.1 percentage points lower) than in the control group **(b)**.
>
> Since the $p$-value of 0.058 exceeds our pre-specified $\alpha = 0.05$ **(c)**, there is marginal but insufficient evidence to conclude the true proportions differ, and we fail to reject the null hypothesis **(d)**. We conclude there is not a statistically significant difference in mortality between the treatment and control groups.

---

**What each label represents:**

| Label | Component | What was reported |
|---|---|---|
| **(a)** | Test statistic and $p$-value | $z = -1.90$, $p = 0.058$, test type named |
| **(b)** | Estimate + 95% CI with units | Risk difference = −2.5 percentage points (95% CI: −5.1 to 0.1 pp) |
| **(c)** | $\alpha$ level | Pre-specified $\alpha = 0.05$ |
| **(d)** | Conclusion about $H_0$ | Fail to reject $H_0$; conclusion stated in context |

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Saying "we accept the null hypothesis"**

> ~~"We accept $H_0$ and conclude there is no difference."~~

Failing to reject is not the same as proving the null is true. A study with low power might miss a real effect.

**Omitting the confidence interval**

The $p$-value tells you whether a result is statistically significant. The confidence interval tells you *how large* the effect might plausibly be. Both are needed.

**Reporting a difference without units**

> ~~"The treatment group had a lower proportion."~~

Always specify the magnitude and units: *"The treatment group had a proportion 2.5 percentage points lower (95% CI: 0.1 to 5.1 percentage points lower)."*

**Confusing "percent" and "percentage points"**

A change from 8.1% to 5.6% is a difference of **2.5 percentage points** (absolute) and a **31% relative reduction**. These are not interchangeable. In most homework write-ups, you will report the absolute difference in percentage points.

**Forgetting to name the test**

Always identify what test you used: *z-test, two-sample t-test, chi-squared test of independence*, etc.

# Quick Reference: Grading Criteria

Recall that the interpretation and communication criterion in this course (2 points) looks for:

> *Answers include written interpretation where appropriate, with an attempt to explain results in context (e.g., direction, magnitude, units, or meaning of statistical output).*

Using this guide as a checklist will help you meet that criterion consistently.
