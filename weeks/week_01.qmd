<!--
Think of the weekly page as answering just five student questions:
	1.	What are we doing this week?
	2.	What do I need to read/watch before class?
	3.	What materials should I have open during class?
	4.	What is due (and when)?
	5.	Where do I go if I want to review later?
	-->
	
## Overview

This week introduces the course structure, expectations, and the role of data as the foundation of biostatistics. We will focus on how data are collected and how to summarize numerical variables.

By the end of the week, you should be able to:

- describe different types of data,
- compute and interpret basic numerical summaries,
- feel comfortable navigating R and RStudio.

## Readings (before class)

- Textbook sections 1.1–1.4

(Additional resources will be posted if helpful.)
