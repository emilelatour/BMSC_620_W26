<!--
Think of the weekly page as answering just five student questions:
	1.	What are we doing this week?
	2.	What do I need to read/watch before class?
	3.	What materials should I have open during class?
	4.	What is due (and when)?
	5.	Where do I go if I want to review later?
	-->

## Announcements

- New TA: Nick Chaiyachakorn
- HW 0 Solutions released, and homework grading policy
- Reminder: No class next Monday, January 19


## Overview

This week focuses on **categorical data and probability**.

We will learn how to summarize and compare categorical variables using tables and plots, and then introduce the basic ideas of probability, conditional probability, and Bayes’ theorem. These concepts form the foundation for statistical inference later in the course.

By the end of the week, you should be able to:

- summarize categorical variables using counts and proportions,
- interpret contingency tables using row and column percentages,
- understand probability as a long-run proportion,
- compute conditional probabilities from tables,
- use Bayes’ theorem to reverse conditioning in applied examples.

## Readings (before class)

- Textbook sections 1.5–1.7 (categorical data and relationships)
- Textbook sections 2.1–2.2 (probability and conditional probability)

(Additional resources will be posted if helpful.)

## Materials

I was trying out new recording software today, and there was a glitch about 1 hour and 20 minutes into class. You are not missing any required material; the full lecture is covered across the two recordings.

**Part 1** (the first ~1 hour and 20 minutes) is available on OneDrive in MP4 format.
**Part 2** (the final ~10 minutes of class) is available via Loom.
  

- **Muddy points**
  
  I reviewed your post-class feedback and wrote clarifications here:

  - Sample space and events
  - Complements and probability rules
  - Conditional probability
  - Bayes’ theorem
  - Diagnostic testing example (PPV)

- **Slides**
  - Probability and conditional probability (HTML | PDF | Recording – links coming)

## Homework

- **HW 1**
  - Due **Sunday at 11:00 pm**
  - Covers:
    - vectors and missing values
    - numeric and categorical summaries
    - contingency tables
    - histograms and box plots
  - [View HW 1 instructions](/homework/HW01/HW01.qmd)

- See the full list of assignments on the [Homework](/homework.qmd) page.

## Post-class check-in (attendance)

- Please complete the post-class check-in after each class meeting.
- Used for attendance credit and to identify topics that need clarification.
- Link: [Post-class check-in](https://forms.gle/AMX1S1vCGEEfmwLY6)

## Looking ahead

There is **no class next Monday**.

Next Wednesday we will begin **data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, including:

- histograms, box plots, and scatterplots,
- data frames vs tibbles,
- subsetting and filtering data,
- an introduction to `ggplot2`.

These tools will help us move from summaries to storytelling with data.
