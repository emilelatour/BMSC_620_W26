<!--
Think of the weekly page as answering just five student questions:
	1.	What are we doing this week?
	2.	What do I need to read/watch before class?
	3.	What materials should I have open during class?
	4.	What is due (and when)?
	5.	Where do I go if I want to review later?
	-->

## Announcements

- No class Monday, January 19 (MLK Day)
- HW 1 due Sunday at 11:00 pm


## Overview

This week focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization**.

We will learn how to explore and visualize data using histograms, box plots, and scatterplots. We'll also introduce data frames and tibbles, practice subsetting and filtering data, and begin working with `ggplot2` for creating publication-quality graphics.

By the end of the week, you should be able to:

- create and interpret histograms and box plots for numeric data,
- use scatterplots to explore relationships between variables,
- understand the difference between data frames and tibbles,
- subset and filter data effectively,
- create basic plots using `ggplot2`.

## Readings (before class)

- Textbook section 2.2 (Bayes' Theorem)
- Textbook section 1.7 (exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization)

(Additional resources will be posted if helpful.)

## Homework

- **HW 2**
  - Due **Sunday, January 25 at 11:00 pm**
  - Covers:
    - data wrangling with `dplyr` (`filter()`, `select()`, `mutate()`)
    - summary statistics with `rstatix`
    - frequency tables with `janitor`
    - data visualization with `ggplot2` (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, bar charts)
    - probability concepts (marginal, joint, and conditional probabilities)
  - [View HW 2 instructions](/homework/HW02/HW02.qmd)

- See the full list of assignments on the [Homework](/homework.qmd) page.

## Post-class check-in (attendance)

- Please complete the post-class check-in after each class meeting.
- Used for attendance credit and to identify topics that need clarification.

## Looking ahead

Next week we will introduce **random variables and probability distributions**:

- **Monday**: Random variables and the binomial distribution
- **Wednesday**: Normal distribution and sampling distributions

These concepts form the foundation for statistical inference and hypothesis testing later in the course.
