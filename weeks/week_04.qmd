<!--
Think of the weekly page as answering just five student questions:
	1.	What are we doing this week?
	2.	What do I need to read/watch before class?
	3.	What materials should I have open during class?
	4.	What is due (and when)?
	5.	Where do I go if I want to review later?
	-->

## Announcements

- HW 2 due **Tuesday, January 27 at 11:00 pm**
- HW 3 released **Monday, January 26**


## Overview

This week focuses on **random variables and probability distributions**.

We will learn about discrete and continuous random variables, calculate expected values and variances, and work with two fundamental probability distributions: the Binomial distribution and the Normal distribution.

By the end of the week, you should be able to:

- define random variables and distinguish between discrete and continuous types,
- calculate expected values and variances of random variables,
- work with linear combinations of random variables,
- identify when the Binomial distribution applies and calculate probabilities,
- understand properties of the Normal distribution,
- work with sampling distributions and the Central Limit Theorem.

## Readings (before class)

- Textbook section 3.1 (Random variables)
- Textbook section 3.2 (Binomial distribution)
- Textbook section 3.3 (Normal distribution)
- Textbook section 3.4 (Sampling distributions)

(Additional resources will be posted if helpful.)

## Post-class check-in (attendance)

- Please complete the post-class check-in after each class meeting.
- Used for attendance credit and to identify topics that need clarification.

## Looking ahead

Next week we will begin **statistical inference**:

- **Monday**: Confidence intervals
- **Wednesday**: Hypothesis testing introduction

These concepts are the foundation for drawing conclusions from data and making decisions based on evidence.
