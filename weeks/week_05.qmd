<!--
Think of the weekly page as answering just five student questions:
	1.	What are we doing this week?
	2.	What do I need to read/watch before class?
	3.	What materials should I have open during class?
	4.	What is due (and when)?
	5.	Where do I go if I want to review later?

## Announcements

- HW 4 released **Monday, February 2**


## Overview

This week focuses on **statistical inference**: making conclusions about populations based on sample data.

We will learn how to estimate population parameters using confidence intervals and how to test hypotheses about population parameters using hypothesis tests.

By the end of the week, you should be able to:

- understand the concept of a sampling distribution and standard error,
- construct and interpret confidence intervals for a population mean,
- explain what a confidence level means,
- state null and alternative hypotheses,
- conduct and interpret one-sample t-tests,
- understand p-values and statistical significance,
- recognize the connection between confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.

## Readings (before class)

- Textbook section 4.1 (Variability in estimates)
- Textbook section 4.2 (Confidence intervals)
- Textbook section 4.3 (Hypothesis testing)
- Textbook section 5.1 (Single-sample inference with the t-distribution)

(Additional resources will be posted if helpful.)

## Post-class check-in (attendance)

- Please complete the post-class check-in after each class meeting.
- Used for attendance credit and to identify topics that need clarification.

## Looking ahead

Next week we will continue with **statistical inference**:

- **Monday**: Paired data and paired t-tests; Two-sample independent t-tests
- **Wednesday**: Midterm review

These concepts extend our hypothesis testing framework to compare two groups and handle related measurements.
