<!--
Think of the weekly page as answering just five student questions:
	1.	What are we doing this week?
	2.	What do I need to read/watch before class?
	3.	What materials should I have open during class?
	4.	What is due (and when)?
	5.	Where do I go if I want to review later?
	-->

## Announcements

- **Midterm Exam** opens **Wednesday, February 11 at 3:00 PM** and closes **Monday, February 16 at 11:00 PM**


## Overview

This week focuses on **comparing two groups** and **preparing for the midterm**.

On Monday, we will extend our hypothesis testing framework to scenarios with two groups, distinguishing between paired (dependent) data and independent samples. On Wednesday, we will review all material covered so far and prepare for the midterm exam.

By the end of the week, you should be able to:

- distinguish between paired and independent samples based on study design,
- perform paired t-tests for dependent data,
- conduct two-sample t-tests for independent groups,
- choose the appropriate test based on how data were collected,
- synthesize and apply all concepts from Weeks 1-5.

## Readings (before class)

- Textbook section 5.2 (Paired data)
- Textbook section 5.3 (Difference of two means)

(Additional resources will be posted if helpful.)

## Midterm Exam

- **Opens:** Wednesday, February 11 at 3:00 PM
- **Closes:** Monday, February 16 at 11:00 PM
- **Format:** 8 parts, 120 points total, designed for 3-5 hours completion
- **Coverage:** Lessons 1-9 (through hypothesis testing and one-sample t-tests)
- **Resources allowed:** Course materials, R documentation, your notes
- **NOT allowed:** Collaboration with others, AI assistants, online help forums
- **Submit:** Both `.qmd` and `.html` files

## Post-class check-in (attendance)

- Please complete the post-class check-in after each class meeting.
- Used for attendance credit and to identify topics that need clarification.

## Looking ahead

After the midterm, we will continue building our statistical inference toolkit:

- **Week 7**: Inference for proportions (single and two-sample)
- **Week 8**: Chi-squared tests and categorical data analysis

These concepts extend our hypothesis testing framework to categorical outcomes and proportions.
