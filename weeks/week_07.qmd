Think of the weekly page as answering just five student questions:
    1.  What are we doing this week?
    2.  What do I need to read/watch before class?
    3.  What materials should I have open during class?
    4.  What is due (and when)?
    5.  Where do I go if I want to review later?

## Announcements

-   **Monday, February 16** is a university holiday (Presidents Day) — **no class**
-   **Midterm Exam** closes **Monday, February 16 at 11:00 PM**. Solutions are posted under **Resources** on Sakai. 
-   **HW 5** is due **Sunday, February 22 at 11:00 PM**

## Overview

This week we have one class meeting focused on **power and sample size calculations**.

After completing the midterm, we shift our attention to study design: understanding how to plan research studies with adequate statistical power to detect meaningful effects. Power analysis helps us answer critical questions like "How many participants do I need?" and "What effect size can I realistically detect?"

By the end of the week, you should be able to:

-   understand the four components in equilibrium in a hypothesis test (significance level, sample size, effect size, and power),
-   define and interpret Type I and Type II errors,
-   explain what statistical power means and why it matters,
-   calculate power and sample size for one-sample and two-sample t-tests using R,
-   apply power analysis to both study planning and interpretation of existing research.

## Readings (before class)

-   Textbook section 5.4 (Power calculations for comparing means)

(Additional resources will be posted if helpful.)

## Midterm Exam

-   **Closes:** Monday, February 16 at 11:00 PM
-   **Format:** 8 parts, 120 points total
-   **Coverage:** Lessons 1-9 (through hypothesis testing and one-sample t-tests)
-   **Submit:** Both `.qmd` and `.html` files before the deadline

## Post-class check-in (attendance)

-   Please complete the post-class check-in after each class meeting.
-   Used for attendance credit and to identify topics that need clarification.

## Looking ahead

After the midterm and power, we will continue building our statistical inference toolkit:

-   **Week 8**:
    -   Inference for proportions (single and two-sample)
    -   Chi-squared tests for categorical data
    -   Fisher's exact test for 2×2 tables
-   **Week 9**:
    -   Comparing means across multiple groups with ANOVA
    -   Nonparametric tests (alternatives to t-tests)

These concepts extend our hypothesis testing framework to categorical outcomes and multiple-group comparisons.
