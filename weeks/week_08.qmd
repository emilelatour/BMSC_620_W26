Think of the weekly page as answering just five student questions:
    1.  What are we doing this week?
    2.  What do I need to read/watch before class?
    3.  What materials should I have open during class?
    4.  What is due (and when)?
    5.  Where do I go if I want to review later?

## Announcements

-   **HW 5** is due **Monday, February 23 at 11:00 PM**
-   **HW 6** is due **Sunday, March 1 at 11:00 PM**

## Overview

This week we extend our hypothesis testing toolkit to **categorical outcomes**, covering two full class meetings.

Monday focuses on inference for proportions — from single-proportion tests and confidence intervals through comparing two independent proportions and interpreting 2×2 tables. Wednesday introduces chi-squared tests for larger contingency tables and Fisher's exact test for situations where sample sizes are small.

By the end of the week, you should be able to:

-   apply the normal approximation to the sampling distribution of a sample proportion,
-   conduct hypothesis tests for a single proportion,
-   construct and interpret confidence intervals for a single proportion,
-   test for differences between two independent proportions,
-   interpret data displayed in 2×2 tables and select the appropriate inference method based on study design,
-   conduct chi-squared tests for independence in contingency tables,
-   apply Fisher's exact test when expected cell counts are small, and
-   recognize when each method is appropriate given the data and research question.

## Homework

-   **HW 6**

    -   Due **Sunday, March 1 at 11:00 PM**
    -   Covers:
        -   Power analysis for two-sample t-tests (Cohen's *d*, sample size, power trade-offs)
        -   One-sample proportion test against a historical benchmark
        -   Checking the success-failure condition for the normal approximation
        -   Comparing two independent proportions (two-sample z-test)

## Looking ahead

After categorical inference, we continue building our toolkit:

-   **Week 9**:
    -   Comparing means across multiple groups with ANOVA
    -   Nonparametric tests (alternatives to t-tests when assumptions fail)
-   **Week 10**:
    -   Correlation and association
    -   Introduction to simple linear regression
