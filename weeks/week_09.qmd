Think of the weekly page as answering just five student questions:
    1.  What are we doing this week?
    2.  What do I need to read/watch before class?
    3.  What materials should I have open during class?
    4.  What is due (and when)?
    5.  Where do I go if I want to review later?

## Announcements

-   **HW 7** is due **Sunday, March 8 at 11:00 PM**

## Overview

This week we cover two distinct topics across our two class meetings.

Monday wraps up our unit on proportions with power analysis — how to determine the sample size needed to detect meaningful differences in proportions, including the special case of correlated (paired) proportions using McNemar's test. Wednesday shifts gears to comparing means across more than two groups using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).

By the end of the week, you should be able to:

-   explain why effect sizes for proportions require the arcsine transformation (Cohen's *h*),
-   conduct power and sample size calculations for one-sample and two-sample proportion tests,
-   understand the role of discordant pairs in power analysis for McNemar's test,
-   describe when and why ANOVA is preferred over multiple t-tests,
-   state the null and alternative hypotheses for one-way ANOVA,
-   calculate and interpret the F-statistic,
-   check ANOVA assumptions (independence, normality, equal variances), and
-   conduct post-hoc pairwise comparisons when the overall F-test is significant.

## Readings (before class)

-   No textbook reading for Monday (power for proportions is not covered in the textbook)
-   Textbook section 5.5 (before Wednesday)
